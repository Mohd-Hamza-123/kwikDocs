### HTTP Status Codes

HTTP is a protocol that defines how web servers and clients communicate with each other. It defines the format of the requests and responses that are exchanged between the client and the server. HTTP uses a set of status codes to indicate the success or failure of a request.

### Status Codes

The following table lists the most commonly used HTTP status codes:

* `200` : HTTP 200 is used to indicate that the request was successful.

* `400` : HTTP 400 is used to indicate that the request was malformed or had missing parameters.

* `401` : HTTP 401 is used to indicate that the request requires authentication.

* `409` : HTTP 409 is used specifically when the request conflicts with existing data (like a duplicate resource)
