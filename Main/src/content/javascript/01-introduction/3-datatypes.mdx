#### JavaScript Data Types

JavaScript is a dynamically typed language, meaning variables are not directly associated with any specific data type. Instead, the data type is determined by the value assigned to the variable at runtime.

#### Primitive Data Types

These are immutable and represent a single value:

#### 1. String
Represents a sequence of characters.

```js
let name = "John";
console.log(typeof name);
// "string"
```

#### 2. Number
Represents both integer and floating-point numbers.

```js
let age = 25;
let pi = 3.14;
console.log(typeof age); // "number"
console.log(typeof pi); // "number"
```

#### 3. BigInt
Allows representation of integers larger than the Number type's safe range.

```js
let largeNumber = 1234567890123456789012345678901234567890n;
console.log(typeof largeNumber); // "bigint"
```

#### 4. Boolean
Represents logical values: true or false.

```js
let isActive = true;
console.log(typeof isActive); // "boolean"
```

#### 5. Undefined
Indicates a variable that has been declared but not assigned a value.

```js
let noValue;
console.log(typeof noValue); // "undefined"
```

#### 6. Null
Represents an intentional absence of any object value.

```js
let emptyValue = null;
console.log(typeof emptyValue); // "object" (this is a known JavaScript quirk)
```

#### 7. Symbol
Represents a unique identifier, often used to create private or hidden properties in objects.

```js
let uniqueId = Symbol("id");
console.log(typeof uniqueId); // "symbol"
```

#### Non-Primitive (Reference) Data Types

These are mutable and can hold multiple values:

#### 1. Object
Used to store collections of data and more complex entities.

```js
let person = {
  name: "John",
  age: 30
};
console.log(typeof person); // "object"
```

#### 2. Array
A special type of object used to store ordered collections of data.

```js
let colors = ["red", "green", "blue"];
console.log(typeof colors); // "object"
```

#### 3. Function
A callable object that executes a block of code.

```js
function greet() {
  console.log("Hello, world!");
}
console.log(typeof greet); // "function"
```

#### Type Coercion and Dynamic Typing
JavaScript allows type coercion, automatically converting one data type to another when required.

```js
let num = "5";
let result = num * 2; // The string "5" is coerced to a number
console.log(result); // 10
```
