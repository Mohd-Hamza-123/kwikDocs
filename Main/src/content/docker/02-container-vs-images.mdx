title: Container vs Images
published: true

* Docker Image = Set of code + dependencies + instructions (but not running)
* Docker Container = That code actually running (a real, live process)


Let’s simplify it with a **very basic real-world example** you can relate to.

### 🍳 Real-Life Analogy: **Cooking from a Recipe**

### 🧾 **Docker Image** = Recipe

* It tells you **what ingredients** to use
* It explains **how to cook** the dish
* But the recipe itself is **not food**
* You **cannot eat a recipe**

➡️ **Image** is a fixed set of instructions and files, but **not yet running**

---

### 🍽️ **Docker Container** = Cooked Dish

* When you **follow the recipe**, you **create food**
* You can **serve** it, **eat** it, **throw it away**, or **make another one**
* If you mess up, no problem — just cook again using the same recipe

➡️ **Container** is the **running, live instance** created from the image


#### Technical Analogy (Code Example)

Let’s say you want to run a Python program:

* You use this image: `python:3.11`
* It contains Python preinstalled — like a recipe
* You run:

```bash
docker run -it python:3.11
```

* Now you’re **inside a running container** with Python available
* You can use it, modify it, then stop or delete it
