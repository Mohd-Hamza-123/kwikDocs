## Configuring Environment Variables

Environment variables are crucial for storing sensitive information, such as API keys, database connection strings, and other secrets. In Next.js, these variables can be configured across different environments, ensuring that sensitive data remains secure while allowing flexibility between development, staging, and production.

## Types of Environment Variable Files in Next.js

### **1. `.env` File** — For All Environments

* **Purpose**: Serves as the default environment variables file for all environments.
* **Loaded in**: All environments unless overridden by environment-specific files.
* **Typical Use Case**: Variables that are common across all environments (development, production, etc.).

```bash
# .env
API_KEY="snd1y9hkbh3obysdfi28mjrtbik"
TOKEN_SECRET="4&(@#)Ffsdlkf##T1!43adskfsdkjfsd"
```

The `.env` file contains global variables that should be used across all environments unless specifically overridden.

### **2. `.env.local` File** — For Local Environments

* **Purpose**: Serves as the default environment variables file for local development environments.
* **Loaded in**: Local development environment only.
* **Typical Use Case**: Variables that are specific to the local development environment, such as database credentials for your local machine.

```bash
# .env.local
MYSQL_HOST=localhost
MYSQL_USER=user
MYSQL_PASSWORD="helloworld"
MYSQL_DATABASE=local_db
```

Use the `.env.local` file to store sensitive information for your local setup that should not be shared or committed to version control.

---

### **3. `.env.development` File** — For Development Environments

* **Purpose**: Serves as the default environment variables file for development environments.
* **Loaded in**: Development environment only.
* **Typical Use Case**: Variables specific to development, such as endpoints or feature flags that apply during development.

```bash
# .env.development
API_URL="https://dev-api.example.com"
TOKEN_SECRET="4&(@#)Ffsdlkf##T1!43adskfsdkjfsd"
```

The `.env.development` file is ideal for development-specific configurations like test API endpoints or keys that only apply during the development process.

---

### **4. `.env.production` File** — For Production Environments

* **Purpose**: Serves as the default environment variables file for production environments.
* **Loaded in**: Production environment only.
* **Typical Use Case**: Variables that are specific to the production environment, such as live API URLs and production keys.

```bash
# .env.production
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL="https://prod-api.example.com"
TOKEN_SECRET="4&(@#)F##T1!43*()#@$%^&*()"
```

The `.env.production` file stores production-specific environment variables, such as API URLs or secret tokens for your live application.

## Best Practices for Managing Environment Variables

1. **Security**: Keep sensitive data (such as API keys, database credentials, etc.) in environment variables and never hardcode them in your source code.

2. **Version Control**: Use `.gitignore` to prevent sensitive environment files like `.env.local` from being committed to version control.

3. **Environment-Specific Configuration**: Use `.env.local`, `.env.development`, and `.env.production` to maintain clear separation between different environments. This makes it easy to manage configurations for local development, staging, and production without modifying your codebase.

4. **Public Variables**: For variables that need to be exposed to both the client and server, use the `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix (e.g., `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL`). Variables without this prefix will remain server-side only.
