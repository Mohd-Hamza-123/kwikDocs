title: Creating and Deleting Database
published: true
---


### 1. Start the shell

```bash
mongosh
```

(or pass a connection string if remote)

---

### 2. See databases

```js
show dbs
show databases
```

> MongoDB only shows Databases that **have data**.

---

### 3. Create / switch database

```js
use myDatabase
```

⚠️ This does **not** create the DB yet.
It’s created **when you insert data**.

---

### 4. Drop database

Drop database:

```js
db.dropDatabase()
```

⚠️ Permanent. No undo.


---

### Mental model (easy to remember)

```
mongosh
 └── database (use db)
      └── collections
           └── documents (BSON)
```
