A **pseudo-class** in CSS is a keyword added to a selector that specifies a **special state of an element**.
They are called "pseudo" because they donâ€™t exist as actual classes in HTML, but act like temporary states applied to elements.


**Syntax**

```css
selector:pseudo-class {
  property: value;
}
```

Example:

```css
button:hover {
  background-color: blue;
  color: white;
}
```
