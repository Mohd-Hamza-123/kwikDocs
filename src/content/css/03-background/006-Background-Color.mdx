title: Background Color
published: true
---

**ðŸŽ¨ The `background-color` property sets the background color of an element.**


```css
.bg-color1 {
  background-color: lightblue; /* Sets a light blue background */
}

.bg-color2 {
  background-color: transparent; /* Makes the background transparent */
}
```


```html
<div class="bg-color1">BG 1</div>

<div class="bg-color2">BG 2</div>
```

**Important Point** 


* `background-color` is **not inherited** by child elements.
* By default, a childâ€™s background is **transparent**.
* This transparency makes the **parentâ€™s background color visible** through the child.
* If you set a `background-color` on the child, it will **override** the parentâ€™s background in that area.

Child looks like it has the same background only because of transparency, not inheritance.

**Important Point**

#### background-color on `<html>` tag covers the whole screen

* **Background on `<html>`** â†’ Special CSS rule: it paints the **whole viewport**, not just the content box.

#### border on `<html>` tag does not covers the whole screen

* **Border on `<html>`** â†’ Normal box model rule: it only surrounds the **elementâ€™s box**, which grows only as tall as the content.
