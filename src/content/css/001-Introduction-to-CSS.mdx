**What is CSS ?**
-----------------

CSS, short for **Cascading Style Sheets**, is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML. CSS controls the layout, appearance, and design of web pages, allowing developers to separate content (HTML) from presentation (CSS). This makes web development more efficient, reusable, and manageable.

### **Key Features of CSS:**

1.  _Styling:_  CSS allows you to apply styles such as colors, fonts, and spacing to elements on a web page.
2.  _Layout:_  It helps in creating complex layouts with techniques like grid, flexbox, and positioning.
3.  _Responsive Design:_ CSS enables designs to adapt to different screen sizes and devices using media queries.
4.  _Reusability:_ A single CSS file can style multiple pages
