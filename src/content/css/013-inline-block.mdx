In HTML, elements are categorized into **inline** and **block-level** elements based on how they behave in the document flow.

---

### 🧱 Block-Level Elements

A **block-level element** always starts on a **new line** and takes up the **full width** available (by default). It essentially forms a block or a box on the page.

### ✳️ Characteristics

- Begins on a new line.
- Expands to fill the container's width by default.
- Can contain **other block** and **inline** elements.
- Typically used for **structural layout**.

### ✅ Common Block Elements

```html
<div></div>
<p></p>
<h1></h1> to <h6></h6>
<ol></ol>, <ul></ul>, <li></li>
<header></header>, <footer></footer>
<section></section>, <article></article>
<main></main>, <nav></nav>, <aside></aside>
```

### 🔡 Inline Elements

An **inline element** does **not start on a new line** and only takes up as much width as necessary. It flows alongside other elements like words in a sentence.

### ✳️ Characteristics

* Does **not break** the line.
* Only takes up as much width as required.
* Cannot contain **block-level** elements (only text or other inline elements).
* Commonly used for **text formatting**.

### ✅ Common Inline Elements

```html
<span></span>
<a></a>
<strong></strong>, <em></em>
<b></b>, <i></i>
<img />
<code></code>
<abbr></abbr>, <cite></cite>
```

## 🧪 Example

```html
<!-- Block-level example -->
<div>
  <h2>This is a heading</h2>
  <p>This is a paragraph inside a div.</p>

## 🧠 Tip

You can change an element’s display behavior using CSS:

```css
/* Turn an inline element into a block */
a {
  display: block;
}

/* Turn a block element into inline */
div {
  display: inline;
}
```
