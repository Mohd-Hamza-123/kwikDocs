### **1. Arithmetic Operators**
```python
x = 10
y = 3

print(x + y)   # Addition: 13
print(x - y)   # Subtraction: 7
print(x * y)   # Multiplication: 30
print(x / y)   # Division: 3.333...
print(x % y)   # Modulus: 1
print(x ** y)  # Exponentiation: 1000 (10^3)
print(x // y)  # Floor Division: 3
```

---

### **2. Comparison Operators**
```python
x = 10
y = 5

print(x == y)  # Equal to: False
print(x != y)  # Not equal to: True
print(x > y)   # Greater than: True
print(x < y)   # Less than: False
print(x >= y)  # Greater than or equal to: True
print(x <= y)  # Less than or equal to: False
```

---

### **3. Logical Operators**
```python
a = True
b = False

print(a and b)  # Logical AND: False
print(a or b)   # Logical OR: True
print(not a)    # Logical NOT: False
```

---

### **4. Bitwise Operators**
```python
x = 6   # Binary: 110
y = 3   # Binary: 011

print(x & y)  # Bitwise AND: 2 (Binary: 010)
print(x | y)  # Bitwise OR: 7 (Binary: 111)
print(x ^ y)  # Bitwise XOR: 5 (Binary: 101)
print(~x)     # Bitwise NOT: -7
print(x << 1) # Left shift: 12 (Binary: 1100)
print(x >> 1) # Right shift: 3 (Binary: 011)
```

---

### **5. Assignment Operators**
```python
x = 10
x += 5   # Equivalent to x = x + 5
print(x)  # 15

x -= 3   # Equivalent to x = x - 3
print(x)  # 12

x *= 2   # Equivalent to x = x * 2
print(x)  # 24

x /= 4   # Equivalent to x = x / 4
print(x)  # 6.0

x %= 2   # Equivalent to x = x % 2
print(x)  # 0.0

x **= 3  # Equivalent to x = x ** 3
print(x)  # 0.0
```

---

### **6. Membership Operators**
```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
print("apple" in fruits)    # True
print("grape" not in fruits)  # True
```

---

### **7. Identity Operators**
```python
x = [1, 2, 3]
y = [1, 2, 3]
z = x

print(x is z)  # True, because z points to the same object as x
print(x is y)  # False, because y is a different object with the same content
print(x == y)  # True, because x and y have the same content
```

---

### **8. Special Operator: Ternary (Conditional Expression)**
```python
x = 10
y = 20

max_value = x if x > y else y
print(max_value)  # 20
```
