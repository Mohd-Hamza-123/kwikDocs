The `sys` module provides access to variables and functions that are directly related to the Python runtime environment and the interpreter. It's used for interacting with the Python interpreter.

```python
    import sys
    
    if sys.platform == "win32":
        print("Running on Windows")
    elif sys.platform == "linux":
        print("Running on Linux")
    elif sys.platform == "darwin":
        print("Running on macOS")
    else:
        print(f"Unknown platform: {sys.platform}")
```
