Sets are a built-in data type in Python that represent an **unordered collection of unique elements**. Sets are mutable, meaning you can add or remove elements from a set after it has been created. 🛠️

## Creating Sets �

```python
# Using set() function
my_set = set([1, 2, 3, 4])

# Using curly braces
my_set = {1, 2, 3, 4}
```

## Common Set Methods 🛠️

### 1) `add(elem)`: Adds an element to the set. ➕

```python
my_set = {1, 2, 3}
my_set.add(4)
print(my_set)  # Output: {1, 2, 3, 4}
```

### 2) Removing Elements 🗑️

```python
my_set = {1, 2, 3, 4}
my_set.remove(3)  # Removes an element from the set. Raises a KeyError if the element is not found.
my_set.discard(4)  # Removes an element if it is a member. Does nothing if the element is not found.
my_set.pop()  # Removes and returns an arbitrary element from the set. Raises a KeyError if the set is empty.
my_set.clear()  # Removes all elements from the set.
print(my_set)  # Output: set()
```

### Set Operations 🔄

```python
set1 = {1, 2, 3}
set2 = {3, 4, 5}

print(set1.union(set2))            # Output: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
print(set1.intersection(set2))     # Output: {3}
print(set1.difference(set2))       # Output: {1, 2}
print(set1.symmetric_difference(set2))  # Output: {1, 2, 4, 5}
```

### Subset and Superset Operations 🔍

```python
set1 = {1, 2, 3}
set2 = {1, 2}

print(set2.issubset(set1))  # Output: True
print(set1.issuperset(set2))  # Output: True
```

### Copying Sets 📝

```python
set1 = {1, 2, 3}
set2 = set1.copy()
print(set2)  # Output: {1, 2, 3}
```
