## 1) **`__name__`**

Python module (file) has a special built-in variable called `__name__`.

If the script is being run directly (not imported). The value of `__name__` is set to `__main__`.

```python
# script.py
def func():
    print("variable : ",__name__)
func() # output --> variable :  __main__
```

If the script is being imported, the value of __name__ is set to the name of the script.

```python
# another_script.py
from script import func
func() # output --> variable :  script
```
