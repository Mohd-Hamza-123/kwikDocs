title: Tokens
published : true

In Python, **tokens** are the **smallest meaningful units of source code** that the Python interpreter recognizes during **lexical analysis** (the first phase of parsing).

> **A token is the smallest unit of code that has meaning to Python.**

---

**Real-Life Example**

Sentence:

```
I like apples
```

Tokens:

```
I | like | apples
```

Each word is treated as a separate meaningful unit—similar to tokens in Python.

---

**Python Example**

```python
result = 10 + y
```

Tokens:

```
result | = | 10 | + | y
```

### Why Python Uses Tokens

Python cannot understand code all at once.
Instead, it follows these steps:

1. Break the code into **tokens**
2. Understand how those tokens fit together
3. Execute the code

## Main Types of Python Tokens

### 1. Keywords

Reserved words with predefined meaning.

Examples:

```python
if, else, for, while, def, return, class, import
```

---

### 2. Identifiers

Names used to identify variables, functions, classes, etc.

Examples:

```python
age
total_sum
calculateArea
```

---

### 3. Literals

Fixed values written directly in code.

```python
10        # integer literal
3.14      # float literal
"Hello"   # string literal
True      # boolean literal
None      # special literal
```

---

### 4. Operators

Symbols that perform operations on values.

```plaintext
+   -   *   /   %        # arithmetic
==  !=  >   <   >=  <=  # comparison
and or not              # logical
=   +=  -=              # assignment
```

---

### 5. Delimiters (Separators)

Characters that structure code.

```python
( )   [ ]   { }
,     :     .
;     @
```

---

### 6. Comments

Lines that are ignored by the interpreter.

```python
# This is a comment
```

---

#### Example: Token Breakdown

```python
colors = ['red', 'yellow', 'blue']
```

Tokens:

1. `colors` → identifier
2. `=` → operator
3. `[` → delimiter
4. `'red'` → string literal
5. `,` → delimiter
6. `'yellow'` → string literal
7. `,` → delimiter
8. `'blue'` → string literal
9. `]` → delimiter
