title: Integer Literals

Python supports **four forms of integer literals**, based on how an integer value is written in the source code.

---

## Types of Integer Literals in Python

### 1. Decimal Integer Literals (Base 10)

Digits used: `0–9`  
This is the **default** number system in Python.

```python
10
25
0
-99
````

---

### 2. Binary Integer Literals (Base 2)

Prefix: `0b` or `0B`
Digits used: `0`, `1`

```python
0b1010    # 10 in decimal
0B1111    # 15 in decimal
```

---

### 3. Octal Integer Literals (Base 8)

Prefix: `0o` or `0O`
Digits used: `0–7`

```python
0o12      # 10 in decimal
0O77      # 63 in decimal
```

---

### 4. Hexadecimal Integer Literals (Base 16)

Prefix: `0x` or `0X`
Digits used: `0–9`, `A–F` (or `a–f`)

```python
0xA       # 10 in decimal
0XFF      # 255 in decimal
```

---

### Important Note

Although these literals are written using different number systems, **all of them are stored as `int` in Python**.

```python
type(0b1010)   # int
type(0o12)     # int
type(0xA)      # int
```

* Decimal, binary, octal, and hexadecimal are **forms of integer literals**
* They represent different **notations**, not different data types

### Quick Summary

| Literal Form | Prefix | Base |
| ------------ | ------ | ---- |
| Decimal      | none   | 10   |
| Binary       | `0b`   | 2    |
| Octal        | `0o`   | 8    |
| Hexadecimal  | `0x`   | 16   |

> Python supports decimal, binary (`0b`), octal (`0o`), and hexadecimal (`0x`) integer literals. Regardless of the base used, they are all of type `int`.
