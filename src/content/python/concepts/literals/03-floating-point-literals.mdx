title: Floating-Point Literals

Python supports **two forms of floating-point literals**, based on how a floating-point value is written in the source code.

---

## Types of Floating-Point Literals in Python

### 1. Decimal Floating-Point Literals

Digits used: `0–9`  
These literals contain a **decimal point** and represent real numbers.  
This is the **most commonly used** form of floating-point literal.

```python
3.14
0.5
-12.75
2.0
```

---

### 2. Exponential (Scientific Notation) Floating-Point Literals

Numbers written using `e` or `E`, representing powers of 10.
This form is useful for representing **very large or very small numbers**.

```python
1e3     # 1000.0
2.5e2   # 250.0
1e-3    # 0.001
-3.2E4  # -32000.0
```

---

**Important Note**

Regardless of how they are written, **all floating-point literals are stored as `float` in Python**.

```python
type(3.14)   # float
type(1e3)    # float
```

> Python supports decimal and exponential floating-point literals. Regardless of the notation, they are all of type `float`.
