title: Literals Introduction
published : true

In Python, **literals** are **fixed values written directly in the source code**.
They represent **constant data** that does not change unless you explicitly change it.

> **A literal is a value that appears directly in your code.**

---

**Examples**

```python
10
3.14
"hello"
True
None
```

Each of the above is a **literal**.

## Types of Literals in Python

### 1. Numeric Literals

Numbers written directly in code.

```python
10        # integer literal
3.5       # float literal
2 + 3j    # complex literal
```

---

### 2. String Literals

Text enclosed in quotes.

```python
"Python"
'Hello'
"""Multi-line string"""
```

---

### 3. Boolean Literals

Only two values exist.

```python
True
False
```

---

### 4. None Literal

Represents “no value”.

```python
None
```

---

### 5. Collection Literals

Built-in data structures written directly.

```python
[1, 2, 3]               # list literal
(1, 2, 3)               # tuple literal
{1, 2, 3}               # set literal
{"a": 1, "b": 2}        # dictionary literal
```

---

**Example in Code**

```python
age = 25
name = "Hamza"
active = True
```

Here:

* `25` → numeric literal
* `"Hamza"` → string literal
* `True` → boolean literal

---

### What is NOT a Literal?

```python
x = age
```

* `age` and `x` are **not** literals (it is an identifier)
* Only actual values are literals

**Easy Way to Remember**

> **If it is a value written directly in code, it is a literal.**
