# Mutable vs Immutable in Python

In Python, objects can be categorized as **mutable** or **immutable** based on whether their state (or value) can be changed after they are created.

---

## **Mutable Objects**
- **Definition**: Objects whose values or state can be modified after creation.
- **Examples**: `list`, `dict`, `set`, `bytearray`.
- **Key Characteristics**:
  - Operations like appending, updating, or deleting can alter the object in place.
  - Changes are reflected across all references to the object.
- **Use Case**: Useful when frequent updates to the data structure are required.

### **Example**
```python
# Mutable Example
my_list = [1, 2, 3]
my_list.append(4)  # Modifies the original list
print(my_list)     # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4]

another_ref = my_list
another_ref[0] = 99
print(my_list)     # Output: [99, 2, 3, 4] (original is also updated)
```

---

## **Immutable Objects**
- **Definition**: Objects whose state cannot be modified after creation.
- **Examples**: `int`, `float`, `str`, `tuple`, `frozenset`, `bytes`.
- **Key Characteristics**:
  - Any operation that seems to modify an immutable object actually creates a new object.
  - Safer to use in multi-threaded programs due to their unchanging nature.
- **Use Case**: Ideal for data that should remain constant throughout the program.

### **Example**
```python
# Immutable Example
my_string = "Hello"
new_string = my_string + " World"  # Creates a new string
print(my_string)    # Output: Hello (original remains unchanged)
print(new_string)   # Output: Hello World

my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)
# my_tuple[0] = 99  # This would raise a TypeError

new_tuple = my_tuple + (4,)  # Creates a new tuple
print(my_tuple)    # Output: (1, 2, 3) (original remains unchanged)
print(new_tuple)   # Output: (1, 2, 3, 4)
```

**_Lets Understand this Concept with some examples  :_** 

_Eg 1) :_ 

```py
    x = 10 
    y = x 
    
    x = 20
    
    print(x) # 20
    print(y) # 10
```

_Eg 2) :_

```py
    a = 1000
    b = a
    
    print(a is b) # True
    
    #  a and b point to the same memory location (are the same object)
```
**For Immutables Data Types :**

_For immutable data types, the memory location may or may not be the same when you create a new instance, even if their contents are identical._
```py
    # INTEGERS
    
    x = 100
    y = 100
    
    print(x is y)  # True, because of caching
    
    # x is y , is always true if value is in range [-5 , 256 ] . 
    # This is due to Python's integer interning or object caching mechanism, which optimizes memory usage and improves performance.
    
    
    # STRING 
    
    str1 = "Hello"
    str2 = "Hello"
    
    print(str1 is str2)  # True
    
    str3 = "Hello " + "World"
    str4 = "Hello World"
    
    print(str3 is str4)  # False
    
    # In Python, small strings (usually those with fewer than 20 characters) are often interned, 
    # meaning they are stored in a common memory location to optimize memory usage and performance.
```

**For Mutables Data Types :**

For mutable data types, the memory location will always be different when you create a new instance, even if their contents are identical.

```py
    # LIST
    
    list1 = [1,2,3]
    list2 = [1,2,3]
    
    print(list1 is list2) # False
    
    # SET
    
    set1 = {1,2,3}
    set2 =  {1,2,3}
    
    print(set1 is set2) # False
    
    # DICTIONARY 
    
    dict1 = {"name" : "Mohd Hamza"}
    dict2 = {"name" : "Mohd Hamza"}
    
    print(dict1 is dict2) # False
```
    


### Example of Data Types / Object Types:

1. **Number**: `1234`, `3.1415`, `3+4j`, `0b111`, `Decimal()`, `Fraction()`
2. **String**: `'spam'`, `"Bob's"`, `b'a\\x01c'`, `u'sp\\xc4m'`
3. **List**: `[1, [2, 'three'], 4.5]`, `list(range(10))`
4. **Tuple**: `(1, 'spam', 4, 'U')`, `tuple('spam')`, `namedtuple`
5. **Dictionary**: `{'food': 'spam', 'taste': 'yum'}`, `dict(hours=10)`
6. **Set**: `set('abc')`, `{'a', 'b', 'c'}`
7. **Boolean**: `True`, `False`
8. **None**: `None`
