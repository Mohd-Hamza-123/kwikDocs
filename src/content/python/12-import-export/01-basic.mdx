Suppose you have multiple python files in a directory. You can import variables from one file to another file. 

```plaintext
main.py
app.py
```

The content of the `main.py` file is as follows:

```python
age = 20
name = "John"
```

We want to import the `age` and `name` variables from the `app.py` file to the `main.py` file. We can do this : 

```python
from app import age, name
print(age)
print(name)
```

Another Way to import the variables is as follows:

```python
import app
print(app.age)
print(app.name)
```
