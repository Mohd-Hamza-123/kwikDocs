## **For Loop in Python**

The `for` loop in Python is a powerful and flexible tool for iterating over sequences like lists, tuples, strings, dictionaries, and even ranges. It allows you to execute a block of code for each element in the sequence.


**Syntax**
```python
for variable in sequence:
    # Code block to execute
```

- **`variable`**: A placeholder that takes on the value of each element in the sequence during each iteration.
- **`sequence`**: A collection or iterable object, such as a list, string, tuple, or range.
- The indented code block is executed once for each element in the sequence.


**Examples**

**Basic Example: Iterating Through a List**
```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)
```
**Output:**
```
apple
banana
cherry
```

**Using `range()` in a `for` Loop**
The `range()` function generates a sequence of numbers, which can be used with `for` loops.

```python
for i in range(5):
    print(i)
```
**Output:**
```
0
1
2
3
4
```

- By default, `range(start, stop, step)` starts at 0, ends before the `stop` value, and increments by 1.

```python
for i in range(1, 10, 2):
    print(i)
```
**Output:**
```
1
3
5
7
9
```

### **Iterating Over Strings**
A string is also an iterable in Python. You can loop through each character in a string.

```python
word = "hello"
for char in word:
    print(char)
```
**Output:**
```
h
e
l
l
o
```

### **Iterating Through Dictionaries**
Dictionaries can also be iterated over using `for` loops.

#### Example 1: Iterating Over Keys
```python
person = {"name": "Alice", "age": 25, "city": "New York"}
for key in person:
    print(key)
```
**Output:**
```
name
age
city
```

#### Example 2: Iterating Over Keys and Values
```python
for key, value in person.items():
    print(f"{key}: {value}")
```
**Output:**
```
name: Alice
age: 25
city: New York
```

### **Using `else` With a `for` Loop**
The `else` block in a `for` loop executes after the loop completes all iterations, unless the loop is terminated by a `break` statement.

```python
for i in range(5):
    print(i)
else:
    print("Loop completed successfully.")
```
**Output:**
```
0
1
2
3
4
Loop completed successfully.
```

### **Control Statements in `for` Loops**

#### **`break` Statement**
The `break` statement exits the loop prematurely.

```python
for i in range(5):
    if i == 3:
        break
    print(i)
```
**Output:**
```
0
1
2
```

#### **`continue` Statement**
The `continue` statement skips the rest of the loop's body for the current iteration and moves to the next.

```python
for i in range(5):
    if i == 3:
        continue
    print(i)
```
**Output:**
```
0
1
2
4
```

#### **`pass` Statement**
The `pass` statement does nothing. It acts as a placeholder where a statement is syntactically required.

```python
for i in range(5):
    if i == 3:
        pass  # Placeholder
    print(i)
```
**Output:**
```
0
1
2
3
4
```
