### Definition:

A closure is a function that retains access to the variables of its enclosing scope even after the enclosing scope has finished executing. In Python, closures allow the nested function to remember and use variables from the scope in which it was created.

A **closure** in Python occurs when:

1. A **nested function** (child function) is defined inside a **parent function**.
2. The **nested function** captures and remembers the variables of its enclosing (parent) function, even after the parent function has finished executing.

#### Example 

```python
x = 100
def parentFunction():
    x = 50
    y = 60
    print("Parent Fn Executed")
    def childFunction():
        print(x) # output : 50
        print(y) # output : 60
    return childFunction # The childFunction reference is returned, and it includes a closureâ€”a mechanism that "remembers" the references to variables (x, y, etc.) from the enclosing parentFunction's scope.

closure_function = parentFunction()
closure_function()

print(closure_function)  # This is the function
print(closure_function.__closure__)  # This is the closure (mechanism that holds x & y)
```

### Key Points :

1. Not just the childFunction reference is returned, but the closure (which includes the references to variables x, y, etc. from the parent scope) is also returned. This allows childFunction to retain access to those variables even after the parentFunction has finished executing.

2. The closure is not the childFunction itself, but it is an associated property of the childFunction. It refers to the collection of variables from the parent function (parentFunction in this case) that the childFunction "remembers" or has access to even after the parent function has returned.

3. Closure: The closure is the mechanism or context that allows childFunction to access the variables (x, y) from parentFunction even after parentFunction has finished execution. These variables are captured and stored as part of the closure.

4. The definition "A closure is a function that retains access to the variables of its enclosing scope" is valid in practice, but it's shorthand for describing the combination of the function and the closure mechanism.


Another Example 

```python
def getNum(num):
    def power(x):
        return x ** num
    return power

f1 = getNum(2)
f2 = getNum(3)

print(f1(5)) # 25
print(f2(5)) # 125
```
