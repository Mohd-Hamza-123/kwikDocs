Exception handling in Python refers to managing runtime errors that occur during the execution of a program.

1. Raising an exception and handling it

```python
integer = int("I am not a number") # ValueError: invalid literal for int()
print(integer)
```
Above Code will throw an error because the string "I am not a number" is not a valid integer.
To Fix this error we can use try and except block.

```python
try:
    integer = int("I am not a number")
    print(integer)
except Exception as e:
    print("Error :",e) # Error : invalid literal for int() with base 10: 'I am not a number'
```
