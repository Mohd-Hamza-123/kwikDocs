Functions are reusable blocks of code that perform a specific task. They help in organizing code and making it more readable. In Python, functions are defined using the `def` keyword followed by the function name and a pair of parentheses `( )`.

```python
def greet(name):
    """
    Function to greet a person.
    """
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

# Calling the function
message = greet("Hamza")
print(message)
```
