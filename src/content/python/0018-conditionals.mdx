Conditionals in Python are constructs that allow you to execute certain blocks of code based on specified conditions. The most commonly used conditional statements in Python are `if`, `elif`, and `else`.

### Syntax:
```python
if condition:
    # Code block executed if condition is True
elif another_condition:
    # Code block executed if another_condition is True
else:
    # Code block executed if none of the above conditions are True
```

### Example 1: Basic Conditional
```python
age = 18

if age >= 18:
    print("You are an adult.")
else:
    print("You are a minor.")
```
**Output:**
```
You are an adult.
```

### Example 2: Multiple Conditions with `elif`
```python
score = 85

if score >= 90:
    print("Grade: A")
elif score >= 80:
    print("Grade: B")
elif score >= 70:
    print("Grade: C")
else:
    print("Grade: F")
```
**Output:**
```
Grade: B
```

### Example 3: Using Logical Operators
```python
temperature = 25

if temperature > 30:
    print("It's hot outside.")
elif temperature < 15:
    print("It's cold outside.")
else:
    print("The weather is moderate.")
```
**Output:**
```
The weather is moderate.
```

### Example 4: Nested Conditionals
```python
num = 5

if num > 0:
    if num % 2 == 0:
        print("Positive even number")
    else:
        print("Positive odd number")
else:
    print("Number is not positive")
```
**Output:**
```
Positive odd number
```
