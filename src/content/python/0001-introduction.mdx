**Compiled to Byte Code :**

Python source files (`.py`) are compiled into **bytecode** (`.pyc`) **/** **compiled bytecode** (.pyc)  before execution. This Byte Code is mostly hidden but sometimes it is visible especially when we import files. It is low level and platform independent. Byte Code runs faster .

The `**__pycache__**` folder is a directory where Python stores **compiled bytecode files** to optimize the execution of Python programs. It is created automatically by the Python interpreter when a module is imported or executed.

_Breaking down the byte Code File Name_

Byte Code File : index.cpython-312.pyc

1.  **index :** This is the name of the Python module or script (e.g., `index.py`).
2.  **cpython :** Indicates the Python implementation used to generate this bytecode. Here, it's **CPython**, the default and most widely used implementation of Python.
3.  **312** : Refers to the version of Python used to generate the bytecode. In this case, it's **Python 3.12**.
4.  **`.pyc`:** The extension `.pyc` stands for **Python Compiled**. This is a file containing the compiled bytecode of the module.

It works only for imported Files. It not work for top level files.
