### ‚ú® Understanding Scopes in Python

In Python, "scope" refers to the region of a program where a variable is accessible, defining its visibility and lifetime. It determines where and how you can use variables, functions, and objects within your code.


## üî¢ Types of Scopes

Python provides two primary types of scopes:

### üîπ 1. Local Scope

- Variables declared inside a function belong to the **local scope**.
- They are created when the function is called and destroyed when the function ends.

#### Example:
```python
def my_function():
    x = 10  # Local variable
    print(x)  # Output: 10

my_function()
print(x)  # NameError: name 'x' is not defined
```

---

### üîπ 2. Global Scope

- A variable created in the main body (i.e., not inside any function, class, or block) of the Python code is a **global variable** and belongs to the **global scope**.
- Global variables are accessible from anywhere in the code.

#### Example 1:
```python
x = 10  # Global variable
print(x)  # Output: 10
```

#### Example 2:
```python
y = 50  # Global variable

def my_function():
    x = 10  # Local variable
    print(x)  # Accessing the local variable `x`. Output: 10
    print(y)  # Accessing the global variable `y`. Output: 50

my_function()
print(x)  # NameError: name 'x' is not defined
```

#### Example 3:
```python
username = "hamza"  # Global variable

def my_function():
    username = "mohd-hamza"  # Local variable
    print(username)  # Output: mohd-hamza

my_function()
print(username)  # Output: hamza
```

---

## ‚ùó Common Error: UnboundLocalError

#### Example:
```python
username = "hamza"  # Global variable

def my_function():
    print(username)  # UnboundLocalError: cannot access local variable 'username' where it is not associated with a value
    username = "mohd-hamza"  # Local variable
    print(username)  # Output: mohd-hamza

my_function()
```

### üí° Why does it raise an error?

- When you assign a value to a variable inside a function (e.g., `username = "mohd-hamza"`), Python implicitly treats that variable as **local** to the function.
- This decision is made at the time Python **compiles** the function.
- However, at the point where `print(username)` is called, the local variable hasn't been assigned a value yet.
- This causes the **UnboundLocalError**, because Python cannot use a variable before it is initialized within the function scope.

### üîß Solution: Using `global`

#### Example:
```python
username = "hamza"  # Global variable

def my_function():
    global username  # Explicitly declare that `username` refers to the global variable
    print(username)  # Output: hamza
    username = "mohd-hamza"  # Modifying the global variable
    print(username)  # Output: mohd-hamza

my_function()
print(username)  # Output: mohd-hamza
```

### LEGB Rule

The LEGB rule in Python dictates the order in which the interpreter searches for names (variables, functions, etc.) when they are used in code: Local, Enclosing, Global, Built-in. 


- L (Local): Looks for a variable in the innermost (local) scope, i.e., inside the current function.
- E (Enclosing): If not found locally, looks in the enclosing scope(s), i.e., functions that enclose the current function.
- G (Global): If not found in enclosing scopes, looks in the global scope.
- B (Built-in): If not found globally, looks in Python's built-in scope

Example :
```python
x = 100 
def parentFunction():
    x = 50
    def childFunction():
        print(x) # output : 50
    childFunction()
    print(x) # output : 50

parentFunction()
print(x) # output : 100
```
