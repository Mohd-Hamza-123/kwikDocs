## Python Interpreter vs PVM

When you run a Python script, the Python interpreter reads the source code and **compiles** it into **bytecode.**

The Python interpreter then interprets this bytecode using the Python Virtual Machine (PVM), which converts the bytecode into the machine code

Note : The **Python Virtual Machine (PVM)** is typically referred to as the **runtime engine** in Python.
