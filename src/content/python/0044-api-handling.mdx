An API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of rules, protocols, and tools that allows different software applications to communicate with each other. It acts as a bridge between two systems, enabling them to exchange data or functionality without knowing the underlying code or implementation details.

```python
import requests

def getRandomUser():
    url = 'https://api.freepi.app/api/v1/public/randomusers/user/random'

    response = requests.get(url)
    data = response.json()

    if(data.get("success")):
        return data
    else:
        print("Error: API response does not indicate success.")
        return None


def main():
    user = getRandomUser()

    if user:
        print(user)
    else:
        print("Error: Failed to fetch data")


if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```
