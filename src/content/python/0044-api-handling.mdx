An API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of rules, protocols, and tools that allows different software applications to communicate with each other. It acts as a bridge between two systems, enabling them to exchange data or functionality without knowing the underlying code or implementation details.

```python
import requests
def get_random_user():
    url = 'https://api.freeapi.app/api/v1/public/randomusers/user/random'
    try:
        response = requests.get(url)
        data = response.json()
        
        if data.get("success"):
            return data
        else:
            print("Error: API response does not indicate success.")
            return None
    except Exception:
        print("Error decoding JSON response.")
        return None

def main():
    user = get_random_user()
    if user:
        print(user)
    else:
        print("Failed to fetch user data.")
if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```
