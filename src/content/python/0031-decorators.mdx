Decorator is a way to modify the behavior of a function or method without changing its source code. 

### Custom Decorator 

- These are user-defined decorators
- A custom decorator is essentially a function that takes another function as an argument and returns a new function with additional functionality.
- When you use a decorator, it replaces the original function definition with whatever the decorator function returns. 

Eg 1. Basic Custom Decorator

```python showLineNumbers {8}
def sayHello(func):
    def wrapper():
        print("Function start - ")
        func()
        print('Function End - ')
    return wrapper 

@sayHello  # It is Equivalent to: greetFunc = sayHello(greetFunc)
def greetFunc():
    print('Welcome to python')
greetFunc() 
# output :
# Function start - 
# Welcome to python
# Function End -
```

Eg 2. Decorator that measures and prints the execution time of a function.

```python
import time 

def measureTime(func):
    def wrapper(*args,**kwargs):
        startTime = time.time()
        func(*args,**kwargs)
        endTime = time.time()
        # print("total time",endTime-startTime)
        return endTime - startTime

    return wrapper

@measureTime # Walk = measueTime(Walk) or wrapper
def Walk(n):
    print("walk start")
    time.sleep(n)
    print("walk End")

total_time = Walk(5)
print('time taken : ',total_time)
```

### Built-In Decorator 

- These are decorators provided by Python itself. 

### 1) `@Property` Decorator

- `@property` decorator transforms a method into a `read-only property`.
- It allows you to access a method as if it were an attribute.
- We can add additional logic when read,write and delete attributes
- It gives getter, setter and deleter method.

```python
class User:

    def __init__(self, username):
        self.__username = username  # Private attribute

    @property
    def username(self):  # Getter with a meaningful name
        return f"My username is {self.__username}"

    @username.setter
    def username(self, new_username):  # Setter with a meaningful name
        if not new_username: 
            raise ValueError("Username cannot be empty.")
        self.__username = new_username


# Create a User instance
user = User('mohd-hamza')

# Use the getter to retrieve the username
print(user.username)  # Output: My username is mohd-hamza

# Attempt to directly modify the private attribute (creates a new attribute instead)
user.__username = 'Hello'

# The getter still accesses the original private attribute
print(user.username)  # Output: My username is mohd-hamza

# Use the setter to update the username
user.username = 'hamza'

# Confirm the update
print(user.username)  # Output: My username is hamza
```
