Decorator is a way to modify the behavior of a function or method without changing its source code.

### 1) `@Property` Decorator

- `@property` decorator transforms a method into a `read-only property`.
- It allows you to access a method as if it were an attribute.
- We can add additional logic when read,write and delete attributes
- It gives getter, setter and deleter method.

```python
class User:

    def __init__(self, username):
        self.__username = username  # Private attribute

    @property
    def username(self):  # Getter with a meaningful name
        return f"My username is {self.__username}"

    @username.setter
    def username(self, new_username):  # Setter with a meaningful name
        if not new_username: 
            raise ValueError("Username cannot be empty.")
        self.__username = new_username


# Create a User instance
user = User('mohd-hamza')

# Use the getter to retrieve the username
print(user.username)  # Output: My username is mohd-hamza

# Attempt to directly modify the private attribute (creates a new attribute instead)
user.__username = 'Hello'

# The getter still accesses the original private attribute
print(user.username)  # Output: My username is mohd-hamza

# Use the setter to update the username
user.username = 'hamza'

# Confirm the update
print(user.username)  # Output: My username is hamza
```
