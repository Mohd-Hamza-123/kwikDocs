### Examples of Data Types 

1. **Numeric Types**

Python has three numeric types: `int`, `float`, and `complex`.

```python
# Integer
age = 25

# Float
price = 199.99

# Complex Number
z = 3 + 5j
```

2. **String (str)**

Strings are sequences of characters inside quotes.

```python
name = "Hamza"
message = 'Hello Python'
description = """Python is a programming language that lets you work more
efficiently and integrate your software more effectively."""
```

---

3. **Boolean (bool)**

Represents True or False values.

```python
is_active = True
is_admin = False
```

---

4. **List**

Ordered, changeable, and allows duplicate values.

```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "mango"]
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]
```

---

5. **Tuple**

Ordered, **unchangeable** collection.

```python
coordinates = (10, 20)
colors = ("red", "green", "blue")
```

---

6. **Set**

Unordered, **no duplicate elements**.

```python
unique_numbers = {1, 2, 3, 3, 4}  # duplicates removed
```

---

7. **Dictionary (dict)**

Key–value pairs.

```python
student = {
    "name": "Hamza",
    "age": 24,
    "is_active": True
}
```
