**Python** is a **high-level, interpreted programming language** that is known for being **simple, powerful, and easy to learn**.


### Key features of Python:

| Feature               | Description                                                                              |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🧾 **Easy to read**   | Python uses simple English-like syntax (very beginner friendly).                         |
| ⚡ **Interpreted**     | You don’t need to compile it — Python runs the code line by line.                        |
| 🧮 **Versatile**      | You can use Python for websites, apps, AI, data analysis, and more.                      |
| 🧠 **High-level**     | You don’t need to manage memory or low-level stuff — Python handles it.                  |
| 📦 **Rich libraries** | It has thousands of built-in and external libraries (e.g., `numpy`, `django`, `pandas`). |
