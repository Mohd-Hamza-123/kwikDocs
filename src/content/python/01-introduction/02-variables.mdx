title: Python Variables.
published : true

In **Python**, a **variable** is like a **container** (or a box) that **stores data** — such as numbers, text, or other values.
You give the container a **name**, and then you can use that name to **access the value** later.

**Example**

```python
name = "Hamza"
age = 24
```

* `name` is a **variable** that stores the text `"Hamza"`
* `age` is a **variable** that stores the number `24`

```
My name is Hamza
I am 24 years old
```

**Rules for naming variables**

* Must **start with a letter or underscore** ( _ )
* Can contain **letters, numbers, or underscores**
* ❌ Cannot start with a number
* ❌ No spaces allowed
* ❌ Shouldn’t use Python keywords (like `if`, `for`, `print`, etc.)
