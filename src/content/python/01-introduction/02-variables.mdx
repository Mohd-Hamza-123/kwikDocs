Variables in Python are simply names that refer to values.

**Example**

```python
name = "Hamza"
product_name = "PlayStation 5"
age = 77
height = 89.4323
is_graduated = True
is_Failed = False
colors = ["Red" , "Blue" , "Green" , "Pink"]
```

### **Rules for naming python variables**

Here is a clear and concise summary **with examples**:

1. Must start with a letter or underscore

Valid:

```python
name = "Hamza"
_age = 24
```

Invalid:

```python
1user = "error"
```

2. Can contain letters, digits, and underscores

Valid:

```python
user1 = "Ayan"
total_amount = 500
```

Invalid:

```python
user-name = "error"   # hyphen not allowed
full name = "error"   # space not allowed
```

3. Case-sensitive

```python
value = 10
Value = 20   # different variable
```

4. Cannot use Python keywords

Invalid:

```python
for = 5      # invalid
class = "x"  # invalid
```

5. Use snake_case (recommended)

```python
student_name = "Ali"
max_score = 100
```
