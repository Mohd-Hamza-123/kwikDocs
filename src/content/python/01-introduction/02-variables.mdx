title: Python Variables.
published : true

In **Python**, a **variable** is like a **container** (or a box) that **stores data** — such as numbers, text, or other values.


**Example**

```python
name = "Hamza"
product_name = "PlayStation 5"
age = 77
height = 89.4323
isGraduated = True
is12thFailed = False
```

* `name` is a **variable** that stores the text `"Hamza"`
* `product_name` is a **variable** that stores the text `"PlayStation 5"`
* `age` is a **variable** that stores the number `24`
* `height` is a **variable** that stores the number `89.4323`
* `isGraduated` is a **variable** that stores the boolean value `True`
* `is12thFailed` is a **variable** that stores the boolean value `False`


### **Rules for naming python variables**

* Must **start with a letter or underscore** ( _ )
* Can contain **letters, numbers, or underscores**
* Cannot start with a number
* No spaces allowed
* Shouldn’t use Python keywords (like `if`, `for`, `print`, etc.)

Every variable in Python — no matter what type it is —  is ultimately stored in binary (0s and 1s) inside your computer’s memory.
