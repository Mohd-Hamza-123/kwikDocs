### Variables Are Not Storage Containers

In Python, variables **do not store data directly**.  
Instead, they store a **reference** (a label or pointer) to an object in memory.

When you write:

```python
a = 10
```

this is what actually happens internally.

---

#### What Is `a`?

* `a` is a **variable name** (also called an identifier).
* It acts as a **reference** to an object in memory.
* In this example, `a` refers to the object `10`.

---

#### What Is `10`?

* `10` is an **object** of type `int`.
* It exists independently in memory.
* The variable `a` is simply associated with the memory address of this object.

---

#### How It Works Internally

1. Python creates an `int` object representing the value `10`.
2. Python binds the name `a` to that object.
3. The name `a` now refers to the `10` object.

You can confirm the type of `10`:

```python
print(type(10))  # <class 'int'>
```

---

**Key Concepts**

* **Variables are references**, not containers.
* Reassigning a variable does **not** modify the original object.

Example:

```python
a = 10
a = 20
```

Here:

* `a` stops referring to `10`
* `a` now refers to `20`
* The `10` object remains unchanged and is removed only if no references exist

### Creating Variables in Python

Python does **not** require explicit variable declarations.

A variable is created **the moment a value is assigned** to it:

```python
a = 10
print(a)
```
