Class is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines a set of attributes and methods that the created objects can have.

Syntax : 

```python
class ClassName:
    # Class attribute
    class_attribute = "This is a class attribute"

    def __init__(self, parameter1):
        # Instance attribute
        self.instance_attribute = parameter1

    # Instance method
    def method(self):
        print(f"Instance attribute: {self.instance_attribute}")

# Creating an object (instance) of the class
obj = ClassName("Value of instance attribute")

# Accessing attributes and methods
print(obj.class_attribute)       # Accessing class attribute
print(obj.instance_attribute)    # Accessing instance attribute
obj.method()                     # Calling instance method
```

Explanation:

1. `Class attribute` : A variable that belongs to the class and not to any instance of the class. These Variables defined directly within the class (outside any methods).

2. `__init__ method` : A special method that is automatically called when an object is created from the class. It is used to initialize the object's state.

3. `Instance attribute` : Variables defined using `self` inside the __init__ method or other instance methods.

4. `Instance method` : Methods defined inside the class. These methods can access the instance attributes and other instance methods. Require self as the first parameter.

5. `Creating an object` : An object (instance) of the class is created by calling the class like a function.

6. `Accessing attributes and methods` : The attributes and methods of an object can be accessed using dot notation.

### 1) Basic class example

```python
class Animal:
    name = "Dog"
    lifeSpan = 20

info = Animal() # Create an object of the class Animal

print(info) # <__main__.Animal object at 0x0000025DA87AB6B0>
print(info.name) # Dog
print(info.lifeSpan) # 20
```

Limitations of above example :

- Every instance of Animal will share the same name and lifeSpan which limits the flexibility of the code

```python 
class Animal:
    name = "Dog"
    lifeSpan = 20

dog = Animal()
cat = Animal()

print(dog.name) # Dog
print(dog.lifeSpan) # 20
print(cat.name) # Dog
print(cat.lifeSpan) # 20
```
Solution: Use an `__init__` method to initialize instance-specific attributes

### 2) `__init__` method

- With the help of `__init__` method, we can initialize instance-specific attributes.
- `__init__` is also called the **constructor** of a class.
- `__init__` is a special method (also known as a dunder method for "double underscore")

```python showLineNumbers {2}
class Animal:
    def __init__(self,name,lifeSpan):
        self.name = name
        self.lifeSpan = lifeSpan

dog = Animal('Dog',20)
cat = Animal('Cat',15)

print(dog.name) # Dog
print(dog.lifeSpan) # 20

print(cat.name) # Cat
print(cat.lifeSpan) # 15
```

**Important points** :

- `self` is always the first parameter of an instance method in a class.
- `self` is not a reserved keyword. You can use any name, but self is the convention and widely recognized in the Python community.
- When we call any instance method, the reference to the object is automatically passed as the first parameter in the method.
- `self` is used to access variables and methods that belong to the class. We can access both class attributes and instance attributes using self in Python. 

Eg : 

```python
class Animal:
    isAnimal = True
    def __init__(self,name,lifeSpan):
        self.name = name
        self.lifeSpan = lifeSpan
    
    def details(self):
        print("name = ",self.name)
        print("lifeSpan = ",self.lifeSpan)
        print("isAnimal = ",self.isAnimal)

dog = Animal('Dog',20)
dog.details() 

# output :  name =  Dog
#           lifeSpan =  20
#           isAnimal =  True
```

### 3) Accessing Class attributes

```python
class Person:
    name = 'Not Set' # class attribute

    def __init__(self,name):
        self.name = name 

    def showName(self):
        return self.name


person1 = Person("Mohd Hamza")
print(person1.name) # Mohd Hamza
print(person1.showName()) # Mohd Hamza

print(Person.name) # Not Set
```

### 4) `isinstance` method


```python
class Animal:
    def __init__(self,name,lifeSpan):
        self.name = name
        self.lifeSpan = lifeSpan

class Shape:
    def __init__(self,name):
        self.name = name
 
dog = Animal('Dog',20) 

print(isinstance(dog,Animal)) # True
print(isinstance(dog,Shape)) # False

cat = Animal('Cat',15) 

print(isinstance(cat,Animal)) # True
print(isinstance(cat,isinstance)) # False
```

An instance of a subclass is also considered an instance of its parent class in Python, provided the subclass directly or indirectly inherits from the parent class.
