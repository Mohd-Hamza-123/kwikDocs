**Variables** : 
Variables are containers for storing data values.

**Creating Variables** :
Python has no command for declaring a variable.
A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.
```python
    a = 10
    print(a)
```
**Understanding Variables and Objects** 

_In Python, when you write **`a = 10`**, the following happens :_Â 

 **What is `a`?**

*   **`a` is a variable name** (also called an identifier).
*   It acts as a **reference** or **label** pointing to an object in memory.
*   In this case, `a` refers to the object `10`.

 **What is `10`?**

*   **`10` is an object** of the type `int` (integer) in Python.
*   It resides in memory, and `a` is associated with its memory address.

 **How it Works Internally:**

1.  Python creates an object for the value `10` in memory.
2.  Python associates the variable name `a` with the memory address of the `10` object.
3.  You can confirm the type of `10` using `type()`:
```python
print(type(10))  # Output: <class 'int'>
```

**Key Points:** 

*   In Python, **everything is an object**, including numbers, strings, functions, and even classes.
*   Variables in Python are just **references (labels)** to objects, not the objects themselves.
*   When you write `a = 10`, `a` points to the `10` object. If you later write `a = 20`, the reference `a` will now point to the `20` object, and the `10` object will remain unaffected if no other variables reference it.

**We can inspect an object attributes , type , memory location using Python tools and functions**

**1) Viewing the Object Type :**

```python
print(type(10))  # Output: <class 'int'>
```   

**2) Viewing the Object ID (Memory Location) :**
```python
print(id(10))  # Outputs the unique ID of the object '10'
```

**3) Exploring Object Attributes :**
```python
print(dir(10))
# This will output a list of methods and attributes available to the int class, such as bit_length, to_bytes, and more
```

 Everything in Python is an object, and all objects (directly or indirectly) are created by the type metaclass. The type metaclass serves as the ultimate root of Python's object hierarchy, ensuring consistency and flexibility in the language's design. ðŸ˜Š
