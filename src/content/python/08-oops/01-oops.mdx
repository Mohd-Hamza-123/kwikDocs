- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that uses objects and classes to write programs.

- OOP helps in organizing code in a way that models real-world entities, making it easier to understand, maintain, and reuse.

Here are the key concepts:

1. **Class**: A blueprint for creating objects. It defines a set of attributes and methods that the created objects can have.
2. **Object**: An instance of a class. It contains data (attributes) and functions (methods) that operate on the data.
3. **Encapsulation**: Bundling the data and methods that operate on the data into a single unit (class). It also involves restricting access to some of an object's components.
4. **Inheritance**: A mechanism where a new class inherits properties and methods from an existing class. This promotes code reuse.
5. **Polymorphism**: The ability to present the same interface for different underlying data types. It allows methods to do different things based on the object it is acting upon.
6. **Abstraction**: Hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the essential features of the object.
