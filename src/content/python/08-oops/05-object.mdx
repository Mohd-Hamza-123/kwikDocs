## Inspecting Objects in Python

Python provides several built-in tools to inspect objects.

### 1. Viewing the Object Type

```python
print(type(10))  # <class 'int'>
```

---

### 2. Viewing the Object ID (Memory Identity)

```python
print(id(10))
```

> `id()` returns a unique identifier for the object during its lifetime.
> This is commonly the memory address (implementation-dependent).

---

### 3. Exploring Object Attributes

```python
print(dir(10))
```

This outputs all methods and attributes available on the `int` object, such as:

* `bit_length`
* `to_bytes`
* arithmetic and comparison methods

**Key Concepts**

* **Everything in Python is an object** — numbers, strings, functions, classes, and more.

<Callout>
Everything in Python is an object. All objects are instances of a class, and all classes ultimately derive from the `type` metaclass, which sits at the top of Python’s object model.
