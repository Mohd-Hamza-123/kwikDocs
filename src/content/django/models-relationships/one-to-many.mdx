## One to Many

One to Many relationship is when a model has a foreign key to another model. This is the most common type of relationship in Django.


```python
# models.py
class Author(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    
class Book(models.Model):
    title = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    author = models.ForeignKey(Author, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
```

To access all the books of an author, we can use the `author` attribute of the `Book` model.

```python
# views.py
def book_detail(request):
    books = Book.objects.select_related('author').all()
```
