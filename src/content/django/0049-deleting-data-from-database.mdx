In Django, there are multiple ways to delete records from the database. Here's an overview of various approaches:

---

### **1. Using the `delete()` Method on a Model Instance**

To delete a single record, call the `delete()` method on a model instance.

```python
from myapp.models import MyModel
# Fetch the object to delete
obj = MyModel.objects.get(id=1)
# Delete the object
obj.delete()
```

---

### **2. Using the QuerySet `delete()` Method**

To delete multiple records, use the `delete()` method on a QuerySet.

```python
from myapp.models import MyModel

# Delete all objects
MyModel.objects.all().delete()

# Delete objects with a specific condition
MyModel.objects.filter(status='inactive').delete()
```

---

### **3. Bulk Deletion Using Raw SQL**
You can use Django's `raw()` method for custom SQL deletion.

```python
from django.db import connection

with connection.cursor() as cursor:
    cursor.execute("DELETE FROM myapp_mymodel WHERE status='inactive'")
```

---

### **4. Using Django Admin Interface**
- Navigate to the model's admin page in Django's admin panel.
- Use the checkboxes to select records.
- Choose "Delete selected records" from the actions dropdown and confirm.

---

### **5. Overriding the `delete()` Method in Models**
If you need to add custom logic before or after deletion, override the `delete()` method in your model.

```python
class MyModel(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)

    def delete(self, *args, **kwargs):
        # Add custom logic here
        print(f"Deleting: {self.name}")
        super().delete(*args, **kwargs)
```

---

### **6. Soft Deletion**
Instead of removing records from the database, mark them as inactive (soft deletion).

```python
class MyModel(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    is_deleted = models.BooleanField(default=False)

    def delete(self, *args, **kwargs):
        self.is_deleted = True
        self.save()
```

Usage:
```python
obj = MyModel.objects.get(id=1)
obj.delete()
```

---

### **7. Deleting Records with Signals**
Use Django signals, such as `post_delete`, to add logic during deletion.

```python
from django.db.models.signals import post_delete
from django.dispatch import receiver
from myapp.models import MyModel

@receiver(post_delete, sender=MyModel)
def after_delete(sender, instance, **kwargs):
    print(f"{instance} has been deleted.")
```

---

### **8. Using Django ORM Transactions**
Use transactions for bulk deletion with rollback capabilities in case of errors.

```python
from django.db import transaction

try:
    with transaction.atomic():
        MyModel.objects.filter(status='inactive').delete()
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")
```

---

### **9. Django Management Commands**
Create a custom management command to delete records programmatically.

```bash
python manage.py delete_inactive_records
```

Code for the management command (`management/commands/delete_inactive_records.py`):
```python
from django.core.management.base import BaseCommand
from myapp.models import MyModel

class Command(BaseCommand):
    help = 'Delete inactive records'

    def handle(self, *args, **kwargs):
        MyModel.objects.filter(status='inactive').delete()
        self.stdout.write("Inactive records deleted.")
```
