```

#### 1. manage.py

This is a command-line utility that lets you interact with your Django project. You can use it to run the development server, create database migrations, and perform other administrative tasks.

#### 2. __init__.py:
Makes this a Python package.

#### 3. settings.py:
All the configurations of your Django project (databases, installed apps, middleware, etc).

#### 4. urls.py:
The URL declarations for your project. Think of it as the router.

#### 5. wsgi.py:
Used for deploying your project with WSGI-compatible web servers (like Gunicorn).

#### 6. asgi.py:
Used for asynchronous support — if you're using WebSockets or running on an ASGI server.
