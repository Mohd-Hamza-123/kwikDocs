## Django Forms with Request Method

### 1. POST Method

The most common method for submitting forms is the POST method, which sends data to the server for processing.


```python
# appName/forms.py
from django import forms
class ContactForm(forms.Form):
    name = forms.CharField()
    email = forms.EmailField()
    password = forms.CharField(widget=forms.PasswordInput())
```

```html
<!-- appName/templates/my_app/index.html -->
<form method="POST">
    {% csrf_token %}
    {{form}}
    <button type="submit">Submit</button>
</form>
```

In Django, the `csrf_token` is a security measure to prevent Cross-Site Request Forgery attacks. It ensures that the form submission is coming from the same site.


```python
# appName/views.py
from django.shortcuts import render
from registration.forms import ContactForm
def contact_view(request):
    fm = ContactForm()
    dict = {"form" : fm}
    if(request.method == "POST"):
        print(request.POST)
        print(request.POST.get('name'))
        print(request.POST.get('password'))
        print(request.POST.get('email'))
    return render(request,"registration/index.html",context=dict)
```
