## Django Forms with Request Method

### 1. POST Method

The most common method for submitting forms is the POST method, which sends data to the server for processing.

```python
# appName/forms.py
from django import forms
class ContactForm(forms.Form):
    name = forms.CharField()
    email = forms.EmailField()
    password = forms.CharField(widget=forms.PasswordInput())
```

```html
<!-- appName/templates/appName/index.html -->
<form method="POST">
    {% csrf_token %}
    {{form}}
    <button type="submit">Submit</button>
</form>
```

In Django, the `csrf_token` is a security measure to prevent Cross-Site Request Forgery attacks. It ensures that the form submission is coming from the same site.


```python
# appName/views.py
def create_blog_view(request):
    print(request.method) # To check the request method
    print(request.POST) # To check the data sent in the POST request
    if request.method == "POST":
        fm = CreateBlogForm(request.POST)
        if fm.is_valid(): # To validate the form data
            print(fm.cleaned_data) # To check the cleaned data after validation
            name = fm.cleaned_data.get("name")
            email = fm.cleaned_data.get("email")
            password = fm.cleaned_data.get("password")
            # print(name, email, password)
            # perform the action you want to do with the data
            return HttpResponseRedirect('/success-page/') # Redirect to a success page or another view
        else:
            fm = CreateBlogForm() 
    else:
        fm = CreateBlogForm()
    return render(request, 'appName/index.html', context={'form': fm})
```
