### **Naming Convention of Model Attributes/Field Names**

- Field names should be lowercase, with words separated by underscores. 

```python
# app1/models.py
class Blog(models.Model):
    author = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    is_published = models.BooleanField(default=False) 
    blog_publish_date = models.DateField(null=True, blank=True)
```
