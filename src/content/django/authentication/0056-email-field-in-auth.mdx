### Steps to Include the email Field

1. Add the email field to the User model

```python
# models.py
from django.contrib.auth.models import AbstractUser
from django.db import models

class CustomUser(AbstractUser):
    email = models.EmailField(max_length=255, unique=True)
```

2. Configuration in settings.py:

```python
AUTH_USER_MODEL = 'app_name.CustomUser'
```

3. If you are using foreign key of the User Model , then update that Model : 

```python
# models.py
from django.conf import settings
from django.db import models
user = models.ForeignKey(
        settings.AUTH_USER_MODEL,
        on_delete=models.CASCADE,
        default= None,
    )
```

4. Migrate the changes

```python
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```

Note : Solve the error if you get any. Probably you will get inconsistent migrations error.

5. Create a Custom User Creation Form & Custom Authentication Form

```python
# forms.py
from django import forms
from .models import CustomUser
from django.contrib.auth.forms import UserCreationForm,AuthenticationForm

class CustomUserCreationForm(UserCreationForm):
    email = forms.EmailField(required=True,unique=True)

    class Meta:
        model = CustomUser
        fields = ['username', 'email', 'password1', 'password2']

class CustomAuthenticationForm(AuthenticationForm):
    email = forms.EmailField(label="Email", required=True)
```

6. Update the UserCreationForm with the CustomUserCreationForm everywhere in the project.
