### **1. Install Cloudinary Libraries**

First, install the necessary Python libraries for Cloudinary:

```bash
pip install cloudinary django-cloudinary-storage
```

---

### **2. Configure Cloudinary in Django**

#### **a. Add Cloudinary Credentials**

Add your Cloudinary credentials in your Django project’s settings file (`settings.py`):

```python
CLOUDINARY_STORAGE = {
    'CLOUD_NAME': 'your-cloud-name',
    'API_KEY': 'your-api-key',
    'API_SECRET': 'your-api-secret'
}

DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE = 'cloudinary_storage.storage.MediaCloudinaryStorage'
```

* Replace `'your-cloud-name'`, `'your-api-key'`, and `'your-api-secret'` with the credentials from your Cloudinary dashboard.

#### **b. Add `cloudinary` to Installed Apps**

Include `cloudinary` and `cloudinary_storage` in `INSTALLED_APPS`:

```python
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    ...
    'cloudinary',
    'cloudinary_storage',
]
```

---

### **3. Update Media Settings**

Define the media URL and directory for your project in `settings.py`:

```python
MEDIA_URL = '/media/'
MEDIA_ROOT = BASE_DIR / 'media'
```

Cloudinary will handle the storage of media files, and Django will still serve them locally for testing purposes.

---

### **4. Modify Your Model to Use Cloudinary**

Update your models to store image metadata efficiently. Here’s an example:

```python
from django.db import models
from cloudinary.models import CloudinaryField

class Blog(models.Model):
    title = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    content = models.TextField()
    is_published = models.BooleanField(default=False)
    created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
    thumbnail = CloudinaryField('thumbnail', blank=True, null=True)

    def __str__(self):
        return self.title
```

* The `CloudinaryField` automatically integrates with Cloudinary and stores the necessary metadata.

---

### **5. Upload Images to Cloudinary**

#### **a. Admin Panel**

When adding or updating a blog post in the Django admin panel, you can upload images directly. The uploaded image is automatically stored on Cloudinary.

#### **b. Custom Upload Logic**

If you need to handle uploads programmatically, use the `cloudinary.uploader` module:

```python
import cloudinary.uploader

response = cloudinary.uploader.upload(
    'path/to/your/image.png',
    folder='blog_thumbnails'
)

# Store the secure URL or public ID in the model
blog = Blog.objects.create(
    title='Sample Blog',
    content='Content goes here...',
    thumbnail=response['public_id']  # Or 'secure_url' depending on use case
)
blog.save()
```

---

### **6. Fetch Images in Templates**

You can use the `cloudinary` URL in templates to display images:

```html
<img src="{{ blog.thumbnail.url }}" alt="{{ blog.title }}">
```

If you need transformations, Cloudinary provides powerful options for resizing, cropping, or applying effects.

---

### **7. Manage Images**

Use the `public_id` to manage images programmatically:

#### **a. Delete Images**

```python
import cloudinary.uploader

cloudinary.uploader.destroy('blog_thumbnails/sample_image_id')
```

#### **b. Update Images**

```python
response = cloudinary.uploader.upload(
    'path/to/new/image.png',
    public_id='blog_thumbnails/sample_image_id',
    overwrite=True
)
```

---

### **8. Best Practices**

* **Use `public_id` for Better Control**: Store the `public_id` in the model for easy updates and deletions.
* **Leverage Cloudinary Transformations**: Optimize images dynamically for size and quality without re-uploading.
* **Secure Sensitive Data**: Store API keys and secrets securely using environment variables or `django-environ`.
* **Set Fallback Images**: Use a default image for blog posts without an uploaded thumbnail:

  ```python
  <img src="{{ blog.thumbnail.url|default:'path/to/default/image.png' }}" alt="{{ blog.title }}">
  ```

---

### **1. Deleting Images with `cloudinary.uploader.destroy`**

Cloudinary provides the `destroy` method to delete images by their `public_id`. Here's how to implement it:

#### **Example Code**

```python
import cloudinary.uploader

def delete_cloudinary_image(public_id):
    try:
        response = cloudinary.uploader.destroy(public_id)
        if response.get("result") == "ok":
            print(f"Image with public_id '{public_id}' has been deleted.")
        else:
            print(f"Failed to delete image with public_id '{public_id}': {response}")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
```

* **`public_id`**: The unique identifier for the image in Cloudinary. It's stored in the `public_id` field of your model or returned during upload.

---

### **2. Updating the Blog Model to Delete Images Automatically**

To ensure images are deleted when a blog post is deleted, override the `delete` method of your `Blog` model:

#### **Model Implementation**

```python
from django.db import models
from cloudinary.models import CloudinaryField
import cloudinary.uploader

class Blog(models.Model):
    title = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    content = models.TextField()
    is_published = models.BooleanField(default=False)
    created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
    thumbnail = CloudinaryField('thumbnail', blank=True, null=True)

    def __str__(self):
        return self.title

    def delete(self, *args, **kwargs):
        # Delete the associated Cloudinary image
        if self.thumbnail:
            try:
                cloudinary.uploader.destroy(self.thumbnail.public_id)
            except Exception as e:
                print(f"Error deleting Cloudinary image: {e}")
        super().delete(*args, **kwargs)
```

* **Purpose**: This ensures that when a blog post is deleted, the associated Cloudinary image is also deleted.

---

### **3. Manual Deletion**

If you need to delete an image manually outside of model deletion:

#### **Example: Deleting by Public ID**

```python
delete_cloudinary_image("blog_thumbnails/sample_image_id")
```

---

### **4. Validation Before Deletion**

Before deleting an image, you may want to check if the image exists in Cloudinary:

```python
import cloudinary.api

def check_and_delete_image(public_id):
    try:
        # Check if the image exists
        response = cloudinary.api.resource(public_id)
        print(f"Image found: {response}")
        # Proceed with deletion
        delete_cloudinary_image(public_id)
    except cloudinary.exceptions.NotFound:
        print(f"Image with public_id '{public_id}' does not exist.")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
```

---

### **5. Best Practices**

1. **Store Public IDs**: Always store the `public_id` of the uploaded image in your database for easy management.
2. **Error Handling**: Handle potential errors like network issues or invalid `public_id` gracefully.
3. **Secure Deletion**: Avoid exposing the `public_id` or sensitive data directly in your application.

---

### **6. Cloudinary Dashboard**

For debugging or verifying image deletions, use the Cloudinary dashboard. It allows you to browse, search, and manually delete images.
