title: Port Mapping
published: true

### 🔑 **Port Mapping** lets you connect:

> 🔸 The container’s internal port
> 🔸 to your machine’s (host’s) external port

This way, services running **inside the container** can be accessed **from your browser or other tools** on your host machine.

---

### ✅ Example: Basic Port Mapping

Let’s say a Node.js or Python server inside the container runs on **port 3000**.

To make it accessible on your local machine at **[http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)**, you'd run:

```bash
docker run -p 5000:3000 my-app
```

### 🧠 What it means:

```
-p <host-port>:<container-port>
```

* `5000` → port on **your machine** (host)
* `3000` → port **inside the container** (where the app listens)

Now when you go to `http://localhost:5000`, you're reaching the app inside the container on port 3000.

---

## 🔁 Real-Life Analogy

Imagine:

* The container is a **hotel room**.
* The service (like a web server) runs **inside the room** on a specific **phone number** (port).
* Port mapping is like **connecting the hotel room phone to the reception desk**, so **visitors can call in** from outside.

## 🔍 View Port Mapping of a Running Container

```bash
docker ps
```

You’ll see a column like this:

```
PORTS
0.0.0.0:5000->3000/tcp
```

Which means:
**Host port 5000 is forwarded to container port 3000**

## 📌 Common Use Cases

| App              | Internal Port | Typical Host Port |
| ---------------- | ------------- | ----------------- |
| Node.js App      | 3000          | 3000 or 8080      |
| React Dev Server | 3000          | 3000              |
| Python Flask     | 5000          | 5000              |
| MongoDB          | 27017         | 27017             |
| MySQL            | 3306          | 3306              |

### 🔐 Optional: Use `-p` multiple times

Map multiple ports:

```bash
docker run -p 3000:3000 -p 5000:5000 my-app
```
