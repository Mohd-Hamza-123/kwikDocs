title: Running Multiple Containers of the Same Image
published: true
---

Running multiple containers from the same Docker image is one of Docker’s most powerful features — and it’s super easy!


### 🔄 Reusing the Same Image

Each time you run:

```bash
docker run <image-name>
```

Docker creates a **new container** from that image. You can run as many containers as you want from the same image — they are completely **isolated** from each other.

---

### ✅ Example: Run Multiple Ubuntu Containers

Run the first container:

```bash
docker run -it ubuntu
```

Now open another terminal and run:

```bash
docker run -it ubuntu
```

This launches a **second** independent Ubuntu container.

---

### 🏷️ Naming Containers for Easier Control

You can assign names to containers using `--name`:

```bash
docker run -it --name container1 ubuntu
docker run -it --name container2 ubuntu
```

This makes it easier to start, stop, and reference them later.

---

### 📋 View Running and Stopped Containers

List only running containers:

```bash
docker ps
```

List **all** containers (including stopped ones):

```bash
docker ps -a
```

---

## 🔌 Start, Stop, and Remove Containers

### ▶️ Start a Stopped Container

```bash
docker start <container-id or name>
```

### ⏹️ Stop a Running Container

```bash
docker stop <container-id or name>
```

### ❌ Remove a Container

```bash
docker rm <container-id or name>
```

You can also chain commands:

```bash
docker stop container1
docker rm container1
```

---


### ⚠️ Important Notes

Even though all containers use the **same image**, each container is:

* Fully isolated
* Has its own filesystem
* Uses separate memory and CPU resources
* Has a unique process ID

They do **not** affect each other unless explicitly connected (e.g., using Docker networks or shared volumes).
