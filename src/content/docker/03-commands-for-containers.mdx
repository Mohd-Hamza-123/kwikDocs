## 🐳 Docker Basic Commands

A quick guide to commonly used Docker CLI commands for managing containers.

---

### ⚙️ 1) `docker ps` — Show Running Containers  
Lists **only containers that are currently running.**

```bash
docker ps
````

👀 **You can view details such as:**

* Container ID
* Image name
* Ports mapping
* Running status
* Container name

**Example Output:**

```plaintext
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE            STATUS      PORTS       NAMES
07a30fd1c123   react-docker-app Up 2 mins   8080->80     hopeful_wilson
```

🔎 **If no containers are running**, you'll see an empty list:

```plaintext
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE   COMMAND   CREATED   STATUS   PORTS   NAMES
```

📌 **Meaning:** You have **no running containers**.

---

### 📦 2) `docker ps -a` — Show All Containers

Displays **all containers**, including stopped ones.

```bash
docker ps -a
```

🧱 Useful to find old or exited containers you may want to remove.

---

### ⛔ 3) `docker stop <container_id>` — Stop a Running Container

Stops a container **gracefully**.

```bash
docker stop 07a30fd1c123
```

💡 Use `docker ps` first to find the container ID.

---

### 🗑️ 4) `docker rm <container_id>` — Remove a Container

Deletes a container, but only if **it is not running**.

```bash
docker rm 07a30fd1c123
```

⚠️ If the container is still running, you must stop it first:

```bash
docker stop <container_id>
docker rm <container_id>
```

---

### 🧹 Bonus Tip

To remove **all stopped containers at once**:

```bash
docker container prune
```
