title: Installing and Removing Docker Images
published: true
---

Docker provides access to a wide range of pre-built **images** via [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/). These images can be pulled and used to create containers for running applications or development environments.


### 📥 Installing (Pulling) Docker Images

To download an image without running it:

```bash
docker pull <image-name>
```

Example:

```bash
docker pull ubuntu
```

This command downloads the latest `ubuntu` image from Docker Hub.

---

### 🚀 Running an Image (Automatically Pulls If Needed)

```bash
docker run -it <image-name>
```

This command:

* Pulls the image (if not already downloaded)
* Creates and runs a new container

Example:

```bash
docker run -it ubuntu
```

This opens an interactive terminal (`-it`) inside a new Ubuntu container.

---

### 📌 Pulling a Specific Version (Tag)

You can also pull a specific version of an image using a tag:

```bash
docker pull node:18
```

This downloads Node.js version 18.

---

### 🗑️ Removing Docker Images

To uninstall (delete) a Docker image from your system:

```bash
docker rmi <image-name or image-id>
```

Example:

```bash
docker rmi ubuntu
```

If you see an error that the image is being used by a container, you must remove the container first.

---

### 📦 List Installed Images

You can see which images are installed using:

```bash
docker images
```

This shows a table with the repository name, tag, image ID, and size.

---

### 🧹 Optional Cleanup

Remove all unused images to free up space:

```bash
docker image prune
```

Remove **all** images (be careful!):

```bash
docker rmi $(docker images -q)
```
