## 🐳 Docker Commands for Managing Images

Docker images act as blueprints used to create containers. Below are the essential commands to view, pull, build, remove, and inspect images.

---

### 📥 1) `docker pull <image>` — Download an Image

Downloads an image from **Docker Hub** (or another registry) to your system.

```bash
docker pull nginx
````

✔ This fetches the latest `nginx` image.

To pull a specific version (tag):

```bash
docker pull nginx:1.25
```

---

### 🔍 2) `docker images` — List Local Images

Displays all images stored locally on your machine.

```bash
docker images
```

📌 Shows details like:

* Repository (name)
* Tag (version)
* Image ID
* Size
* Created date

---

### 🏗️ 3) `docker build` — Build an Image from a Dockerfile

Builds a Docker image from the Dockerfile in the current directory.

```bash
docker build -t my-react-app .
```

📝 Breakdown:

* `-t my-react-app` → Tags the image name
* `.` → Build context (location of Dockerfile)

---

### 🍱 4) `docker tag` — Rename or Retag an Image

Creates another reference (alias) for an image.

```bash
docker tag my-react-app my-react-app:v1
```

🔥 Useful when pushing to a registry.

---

### 🚚 5) `docker push <image>` — Upload Image to Registry

Uploads an image to Docker Hub (or other registries).

```bash
docker push username/my-react-app:v1
```

⚠️ Must be **logged in** first:

```bash
docker login
```

---

### 🗑️ 6) `docker rmi <image>` — Remove an Image

Deletes the specified image.

```bash
docker rmi nginx
```

To force-remove (used when image is in use by containers):

```bash
docker rmi -f nginx
```

🔎 First stop and remove containers using that image to avoid force deletion.

---

### 🧼 Bonus Cleanup Tip

Remove **all unused (dangling) images** to free space:

```bash
docker image prune
```

Remove **all unused images**, not just dangling:

```bash
docker image prune -a
```
