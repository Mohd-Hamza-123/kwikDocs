## Middleware in Node.js

Middleware plays a crucial role in Node.js applications. It acts as a bridge between the incoming **request** and the final **response**. Middleware functions are typically used for tasks such as:

* Logging
* Authentication
* Error handling
* Data validation or transformation

One key feature of middleware is that it is executed **sequentially**, meaning the order in which you define your middleware functions matters.

## Example: Using Middleware in a Node.js Server

Below is an example of how to implement middleware in a simple Node.js server.

### Main File: `index.js`

This is the entry point of your application. It sets up the server and uses the `logger` middleware.

```javascript
import http from 'http';
import { logger } from './middleware/logger.js';

const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
    // Use the logger middleware
    logger(req, res, () => {
        // Send a JSON response
        res.writeHead(200, { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' });
        res.write(JSON.stringify({ 
            message: req?.message, 
            status: 'ok' 
        }));
        res.end();
    });
});

// Start the server
server.listen(8000, () => {
    console.log('ðŸš€ Server running at http://localhost:8000');
});
```

### Middleware File: `logger.js`

The middleware function logs the request's URL and method, attaches a message to the `req` object, and passes control to the next function.

```javascript
// middleware/logger.js

export const logger = (req, res, next) => {
    console.log(`ðŸ“„ URL = ${req.url}, Method = ${req.method}`);
    
    // Add a message to the request object
    req.message = 'This request is going through the logger middleware';

    // Pass control to the next handler
    next();
};
```

## Key Points to Note

1. **Middleware Function Structure**
   A middleware function typically takes three arguments: `req`, `res`, and `next`.

   ```javascript
   (req, res, next) => { 
       // Perform some task
       next(); // Call to move to the next middleware or handler
   }
   ```

2. **Attaching Data to `req`**
   In this example, we attach a custom property `req.message` for use in the final response.

## Why Middleware is Important

Middleware allows you to:

* **Reuse Code**: Encapsulate logic like logging, error handling, or validation.
* **Simplify Request Handling**: Break down tasks into manageable, reusable functions.
* **Maintain Scalability**: Handle tasks in a structured and modular way as your application grows.
