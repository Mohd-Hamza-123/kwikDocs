title: Delete File (Promise)
description: Create a file asynchronously in Node.js

### Syntax of `fs.promises.unlink()`

```javascript
fs.promises.unlink(path);
```

* **`path`**: Path to the file to be deleted.

**Returns:** A Promise that resolves when the file is deleted or rejects with an error.

---

### Example: Delete a File

This example deletes a file named `sample.txt` from the `public` directory:

```javascript
import fs from 'fs/promises';
import path from 'path';

const deleteFile = async () => {
    try {
        const filePath = path.join('public', 'sample.txt');
        await fs.unlink(filePath);
        console.log('File deleted successfully!');
    } catch (error) {
        console.error('Error deleting file:', error);
    }
};

deleteFile();
```

### Notes

* **Error Handling:**
  Use `try-catch` to manage errors like:

  * File not found (`ENOENT`).
  * Insufficient permissions.

* **File Path:**
  Ensure the file path is correct and resolved using `path.join()` for platform independence.
