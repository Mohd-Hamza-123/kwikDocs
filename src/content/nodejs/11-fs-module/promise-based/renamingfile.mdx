### Syntax of `fs.promises.rename()`

```javascript
fs.promises.rename(oldPath, newPath);
```

#### Parameters:

* **`oldPath`**: The current path of the file (string, Buffer, or URL).
* **`newPath`**: The new path or name for the file (string, Buffer, or URL).

**Returns:** A Promise that resolves once the file is renamed or rejects with an error.

---

#### Example: Rename a File

This example renames a file from `sample.txt` to `new-sample.txt` in the `public` directory:

```javascript
import fs from 'fs/promises';
import path from 'path';

const renameFile = async () => {
    try {
        const oldFilePath = path.join('public', 'sample.txt');
        const newFilePath = path.join('public', 'new-sample.txt');
        await fs.rename(oldFilePath, newFilePath);
        console.log('File renamed successfully!');
    } catch (error) {
        console.error('Error renaming file:', error);
    }
};

renameFile();
```

### Notes

1. **Moving Files:**
   Use this method to move a file to a different directory by providing a new path in `newPath`.

2. **Error Handling:**
   Common errors include:

   * File not found (`ENOENT`).
   * Permission denied (`EACCES`).
