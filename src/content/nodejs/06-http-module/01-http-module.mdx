The **http** module is used to create HTTP servers and handle HTTP requests and responses.

### Create a Server

```javascript
import http from 'http'

const PORT = 8000
const server = http.createServer((request, response) => {
    response.write("This is a response from server")
    response.end()
})

server.listen(PORT,()=>{
    console.log("Server is running on port",PORT)
})
// Type localhost:8000 in your browser to see the response
```
