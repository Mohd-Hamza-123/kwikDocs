The **status code** in HTTP is a three-digit number that indicates the outcome of a request. It is sent by the server to indicate whether the request was successful or encountered an error.

Here are some common status codes:

| Code | Description |
|------|-------------|
| 200  | OK          |
| 301  | Moved Permanently |
| 400  | Bad Request |
| 404  | Not Found   |
| 500  | Internal Server Error |

### Example: Setting Status Code in Node.js

When using the `http` module, you set the status code in the response using the `statusCode` property or directly with `writeHead`.

```javascript
const server = http.createServer((request, response) => {
    response.setHeader('Content-Type', 'text/plain')
    response.statusCode = 500
    response.write("This is a response from server")
    response.end()
})
```

```javascript
const server = http.createServer((request, response) => {
    response.writeHead(404,{"Content-Type": "text/html"})
    response.write("<u>This is a response from server</u>")
    response.end()
})
```
