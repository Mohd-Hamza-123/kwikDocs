### 1. Setting Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory of your project and add the following lines:

```bash
MY_VARIABLE=my_value
```

### 2. Loading Environment Variables

In your Node.js application, you can load the environment variables using the `dotenv` package. To install the `dotenv` package, run the following command:

```bash
npm install dotenv
```

Then, in your Node.js application, add the following code to load the environment variables:

```javascript
import dotenv from 'dotenv';
dotenv.config();
// dotenv.config({path: '.env'})
```

### 3. Accessing Environment Variables

In Node.js, you can access environment variables using the `process.env` object. This object contains all the environment variables set in the operating system or in the shell.

Here's an example of how to access an environment variable:

```javascript
const myVariable = process.env.MY_VARIABLE;
```

In this example, `MY_VARIABLE` is the name of the environment variable. You can access any environment variable by its name.
