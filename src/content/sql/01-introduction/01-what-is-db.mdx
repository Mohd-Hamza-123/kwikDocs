A **database** is an organized collection of data that is stored and managed electronically to enable efficient retrieval, modification, and processing.


Databases can be broadly categorized into:

* **Relational Databases (SQL)**: Store data in structured tables with predefined schemas (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL).
* **Non-Relational Databases (NoSQL)**: Handle unstructured or semi-structured data using flexible formats like JSON or documents (e.g., MongoDB, Cassandra).
