### **Syntax for Selecting Data**

The `SELECT` statement is used to retrieve data from one or more tables. The syntax is similar for both **MySQL** and **PostgreSQL**:

```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name;
```

---

### **Example: Selecting Data from a Table**

```sql
SELECT name, salary
FROM employees;
```

### **Selecting All Columns**

If you don't specify any columns in the `SELECT` clause, all columns from the table will be returned.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM employees;
```

### **Selection by Condition**

You can use the `WHERE` clause to filter the data based on specific conditions. The syntax is similar for both **MySQL** and **PostgreSQL**:

```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
```
