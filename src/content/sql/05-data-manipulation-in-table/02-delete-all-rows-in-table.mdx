### **1. Using `DELETE` Statement**

* **Syntax (Same for MySQL and PostgreSQL):**

  ```sql
  DELETE FROM table_name;
  ```

* **Example:**

  ```sql
  DELETE FROM employees;
  ```

* **Behavior:**

  * Removes all rows from the table while keeping the table structure intact.
  * Logs each row deletion individually, which can make it slower than `TRUNCATE` for large tables.
  * Triggers `ON DELETE` events if defined.

---

### **2. Using `TRUNCATE` Statement**

* **Syntax (Same for MySQL and PostgreSQL):**

  ```sql
  TRUNCATE TABLE table_name;
  ```

* **Example:**

  ```sql
  TRUNCATE TABLE employees;
  ```

* **Behavior:**

  * **MySQL:** Removes all rows from the table and resets auto-increment counters.
  * **PostgreSQL:** Removes all rows from the table but does not reset sequences by default. To reset sequences, use the `RESTART IDENTITY` clause:

    ```sql
    TRUNCATE TABLE table_name RESTART IDENTITY;
    ```
  * Faster than `DELETE` as it does not log individual row deletions.
  * Does not trigger `ON DELETE` triggers.

### **Key Differences Between `DELETE` and `TRUNCATE`**

| Feature                   | `DELETE`                        | `TRUNCATE`                   |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| **Logs Each Deletion**    | Yes                             | No                           |
| **Resets Auto-Increment** | No                              | Yes (MySQL only)             |
| **Triggers Execution**    | Yes (`ON DELETE` triggers fire) | No                           |
| **Rollback Support**      | Yes                             | Depends on database settings |

### **When to Use?**

* Use `DELETE` if you need to:

  * Trigger associated delete events.
  * Retain auto-increment values.
* Use `TRUNCATE` for faster deletion when:

  * Triggers and individual row logging are not needed.
  * In MySQL, you want to reset auto-increment counters.
  * In PostgreSQL, you want to reset identity sequences using `RESTART IDENTITY`.
