### **Syntax for Updating Data**

The `UPDATE` statement modifies existing data in a table. The syntax is similar for both **MySQL** and **PostgreSQL**:

```sql
UPDATE table_name
SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2, ...
WHERE condition;
```

---

### **Example: Updating Data in MySQL and PostgreSQL**

1. **Increase salary by 10% for employees in the Sales department:**

   ```sql
   UPDATE employees
   SET salary = salary * 1.1
   WHERE department = 'Sales';
   ```

2. **Update multiple columns for a specific employee:**

   ```sql
   UPDATE employees
   SET name = 'John Doe', salary = 85000
   WHERE employee_id = 101;
   ```

### **Important Notes**

1. **Condition Clause (`WHERE`):**

   * Always include a `WHERE` clause to specify which rows to update.
   * Omitting the `WHERE` clause will update **all rows** in the table, which can lead to unintended results.

2. **Updating Multiple Columns:**

   * Use a comma-separated list in the `SET` clause to update multiple columns simultaneously.

3. **Impact on Performance:**

   * For large tables, ensure that the `WHERE` clause uses indexed columns to optimize the update process.

### **Key Considerations**

1. **Behavior in MySQL and PostgreSQL:**

   * The syntax and behavior of the `UPDATE` statement are almost identical in both databases.
   * Both require the `SET` clause to specify the columns being updated.

2. **Data Validation:**

   * Ensure the values being updated comply with column constraints (e.g., data type, unique constraints).
