### **1. Using the `DELETE` Statement**

The `DELETE` statement is used to remove rows from a table based on a specified condition. This syntax is valid for both **MySQL** and **PostgreSQL**.

#### **Syntax**

```sql
DELETE FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
```

---

### **Examples**

1. **Delete rows with a salary greater than 100,000:**

   ```sql
   DELETE FROM employees
   WHERE salary > 100000;
   ```

2. **Delete rows where the department is 'Sales':**

   ```sql
   DELETE FROM employees
   WHERE department = 'Sales';
   ```

3. **Delete a specific employee by ID:**

   ```sql
   DELETE FROM employees
   WHERE employee_id = 1;
   ```

### **Important Notes**

1. **Condition Clause:**

   * Always use the `WHERE` clause to specify the rows you want to delete. Without it, **all rows in the table will be deleted**.

2. **Impact on Auto-Increment Columns:**

   * Deleting rows does not reset the values of auto-increment columns.

3. **Performance Tip:**

   * For large tables, consider using indexed columns in the `WHERE` clause to improve the performance of the `DELETE` operation.
