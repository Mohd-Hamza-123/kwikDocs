#### **Switching Database in MySQL**

```sql
USE database_name;
```

#### **Switching Database in PostgreSQL**

```sql
\c database_name;
```

-  **\c** is a **psql** meta-command and is only valid within the PostgreSQL command-line interface (psql). If you’re running this command in another client (e.g., pgAdmin, a query editor, or through a programming language), it won’t recognize **\c**.

- If you are using pgadmin then disconnect from the current database and reconnect to the desired one. GUI clients typically have dropdowns or options to select a database.
