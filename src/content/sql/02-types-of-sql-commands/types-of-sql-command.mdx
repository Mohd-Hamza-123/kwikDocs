SQL commands are categorized into different types based on their functionality. Here's a breakdown of the main types:

---

### 1. **Data Definition Language (DDL)**

* Defines the structure of a database and its objects (e.g., tables, indexes).
* **Commands**:

  * `CREATE`: Create a new database object (e.g., table, database).

    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE Students (ID INT, Name VARCHAR(50));
    ```
  * `ALTER`: Modify an existing database object.

    ```sql
    ALTER TABLE Students ADD Age INT;
    ```
  * `DROP`: Delete a database object permanently.

    ```sql
    DROP TABLE Students;
    ```
  * `TRUNCATE`: Remove all records from a table without logging individual row deletions.

    ```sql
    TRUNCATE TABLE Students;
    ```

---

### 2. **Data Manipulation Language (DML)**

* Deals with the manipulation of data within tables.
* **Commands**:

  * `INSERT`: Add new records to a table.

    ```sql
    INSERT INTO Students (ID, Name, Age) VALUES (1, 'Alice', 20);
    ```
  * `UPDATE`: Modify existing records.

    ```sql
    UPDATE Students SET Age = 21 WHERE ID = 1;
    ```
  * `DELETE`: Remove specific records.

    ```sql
    DELETE FROM Students WHERE ID = 1;
    ```

### 3. **Data Query Language (DQL)**

* Retrieves data from a database.
* **Command**:

  * `SELECT`: Fetch data from a table.

    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM Students;
    ```

---

### 4. **Transaction Control Language (TCL)**

* Manages database transactions to ensure data integrity.
* **Commands**:

  * `COMMIT`: Save changes permanently.

    ```sql
    COMMIT;
    ```
  * `ROLLBACK`: Undo changes made in the current transaction.

    ```sql
    ROLLBACK;
    ```
  * `SAVEPOINT`: Create a point within a transaction to roll back to.

    ```sql
    SAVEPOINT SavePoint1;
    ```
  * `SET TRANSACTION`: Define transaction properties (e.g., isolation level).

    ```sql
    SET TRANSACTION READ ONLY;
    ```

---

### 5. **Data Control Language (DCL)**

* Controls access to data within the database.
* **Commands**:

  * `GRANT`: Give privileges to users.

    ```sql
    GRANT SELECT, INSERT ON Students TO User1;
    ```
  * `REVOKE`: Remove privileges from users.

    ```sql
    REVOKE SELECT, INSERT ON Students FROM User1;
    ```

---

### 6. **Data Administration Commands (DAC)**

* Used for database administration tasks.
* **Commands**:

  * `SHOW`: Display database or server information.

    ```sql
    SHOW TABLES;
    ```
  * `DESC`: Describe the structure of a table.

    ```sql
    DESC Students;
    ```
