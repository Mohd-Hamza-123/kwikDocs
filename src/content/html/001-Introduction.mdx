### **1) Client**

A **client** is a device or software that requests information or services from a server. Clients include:

* **Web browsers** like Google Chrome, Firefox, and Safari, which request web pages from servers.
* **Mobile apps** that retrieve data from APIs hosted on servers.
* **IoT devices** such as smart thermostats or home assistants that request updates or send data to servers.

---

### **2) Server**

A **server** is a device or software that stores, processes, and delivers data to clients. Servers can be:

* **Physical computers**, such as dedicated machines hosting websites.
* **Cloud servers**, like those offered by AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure.
* **Virtual servers** or software applications running on hardware.

### **Client-Server Architecture**

Client-server architecture is a model where clients request services, and servers fulfill those requests.

### **How it works:**

1. **Client sends a request**: A web browser requests a webpage.
2. **Server processes the request**: The server retrieves the requested data or computes the result.
3. **Server sends a response**: The server sends the data (e.g., HTML content) back to the client.
4. **Client displays the response**: The browser renders the webpage.

To build the client side of a web application, you typically need:

1. **HTML** for structure.
2. **CSS** for styling.
3. **JavaScript** for interactivity.

### **What is HTML ?**

**HTML (HyperText Markup Language)** is the standard markup language used to create web pages. It provides the basic structure of a website, which is then styled with CSS and made interactive with JavaScript.

#### **Example Code:**

Hereâ€™s a simple HTML template for a web page:
<HtmlEditor defaultCode={`<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>My First Webpage</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Welcome to My Website!</h1>
    <p>This is a basic example of an HTML document.</p>
</body>
</html>
`}/>
