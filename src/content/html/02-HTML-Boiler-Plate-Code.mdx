<CopyCode code={`<!DOCTYPE html>
<!-- This tells the browser which version of HTML is being used. -->
<html lang="en">
<!-- Indicates that the content's language is English. -->
<head>
    <!-- The "head" section contains meta-information about the document, such as title, styles, and scripts. -->
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <!-- Ensures the correct rendering of text and symbols in the document. -->
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <!-- Makes the webpage responsive to different screen sizes. -->
    <title>title</title>
    <!-- Sets the title of the webpage, displayed in the browser tab. -->
</head>
<body>
    <!-- The "body" section contains the main content of the webpage visible to users. -->

### Explanation of Boilerplate Tags

* **`<!DOCTYPE html>`** : Declares the document type and version (HTML5 in this case).
 

* **`<html lang="en">`**

  * `<html>` is the root tag of the HTML document.
  * lang="en" : Specifies the primary language of the content (English here).
  
  
  If you to write in another language in content you can change the value the `lang` attribute.

  ```html
  <html>
    <p lang="ar">كُلُّ نَفْسٍ ذَائِقَةُ الْمَوْتِ</p>
    <p lang="hi">हर दिन एक नई शुरुआत है।</p>
    <p lang="ja">全員が幸せなのです。</p>
    <p lang="ko">모두가 즐거운 것이에요.</p>
  </html>
  ```

* **`<head>`**

  * Contains metadata for the document, including:

    * Rendering of text and symbols
    * The viewport settings.
    * The page title.

* **`<meta charset="UTF-8">`**

  * Support for a wide range of symbols and languages.
  * Without this tag, the browser may not display certain characters correctly.

```html
<html>
Greek: α, β, γ (alpha, beta, gamma)
Cyrillic: Д, Ж, Ю
Arabic: ب, ش, ق
Hebrew: ש, ל, כ
</html>
```

* **`<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">`**

  * Makes the webpage responsive by setting the width of the viewport to the device's width.
  * Ensures the content scales properly on different devices.

* **`<title>`**
