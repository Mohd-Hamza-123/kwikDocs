The `<pre>` tag defines preformatted text. Its primary purpose is to preserve the exact formatting of the text within its content, including spaces, line breaks, and tabs, which are typically collapsed or ignored by browsers in standard HTML rendering

<HtmlEditor id={1} defaultCode={`<pre>
Text in a pre element
is displayed in a fixed-width
font, and it preserves
both      spaces and
line breaks
</pre>
`}/>
