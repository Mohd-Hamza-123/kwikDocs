The HTML `<img>` tag is used to embed an image in a web page.

The `<img>` tag has two required attributes:

*   src - Specifies the path to the image
*   alt - Specifies an alternate text if image cannot be not displayed.

```html
<!-- Syntax for img tag -->
<img src="url" alt="alternateText">
```

There are two main ways to specify image locations in HTML: **absolute** and **relative** paths.


### **1) Absolute Image Path**

An absolute image path is the full URL to an image on the internet or your server. It does not depend on the location of your HTML file.

<HtmlEditor defaultCode={`<img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/13725650/pexels-photo-13725650.jpeg" width="200" height="200" alt="Example Photo">`}/>

### **2) Relative Image Path**

A relative image path points to an image file relative to the location of your HTML file. It's useful when your images are stored in your project folder.

```html
<img src="images/flower.jpg" alt="flower">
<img src="./images/flower.jpg" alt="flower">
```
