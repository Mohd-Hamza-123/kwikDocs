Before diving into the world of web development, it's essential to understand what is client and server, and how they work together.


### **1) Client**

A **client** is a device or software that request and receives data or services from a server. Clients include :

* **Web browsers** like Google Chrome, Firefox, and Safari, which request web pages from servers.
* **Mobile apps** that retrieve data from servers like youtube or facebook.
* **Desktop Applications** 
* **Command Line Tools** : Curl, git etc
* **Game Clients** : PUBG, Fortnite client
* **IoT devices** such as smart thermostats or home assistants that request updates or send data to servers.

In general any **Software** or **Device** that initiates a request to a server is a client.

### **2) Server**

A **server** is a device or software that stores, processes, and delivers data to clients. Eg : Google server stores gmail account data, provide search results, and sends emails.

Servers can be:

* **Physical computers**, such as dedicated machines hosting websites.
* **Cloud servers**, like those offered by AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure.
* **Virtual servers** or software applications running on hardware.

### **Client-Server Architecture**

Client-server architecture is a model where clients request services, and servers fulfill those requests.

**How it works:**

1. **Client sends a request** 
2. **Server processes the request**: The server retrieves the requested data or computes the result.
3. **Server sends a response**: The server sends the data back to the client.
4. **Client displays the response**

To build the client side of a web application, you typically need:
1. **HTML** for structure.
2. **CSS** for styling.
3. **JavaScript** for interactivity.

### **What is HTML ?**

**HTML (HyperText Markup Language)** is the standard markup language used to create web pages. It provides the basic structure of a website, which is then styled with CSS and made interactive with JavaScript.

**Example Code:**

<HtmlEditor defaultCode={`<html lang="en">
<body>
    <h1>Welcome to My Website!</h1>
    <p>This is a basic example of an HTML document.</p>
</body>
</html>`}/>
