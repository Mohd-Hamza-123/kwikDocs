title: What is Typescript ?
published: true
---

TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds static typing, enabling developers to catch errors at compile time instead of runtime.

Think of it as:

> JavaScript + type checking + better tooling

It helps catch errors **before** running the code and makes code easier to understand and maintain.

### Why TypeScript exists

JavaScript does not check types:

```js
let age = "20";
age = 20;    // allowed, no error
```

TypeScript adds **type safety**:

```ts
let age: number = 20;
age = "20";   // Error: Type 'string' is not assignable to type 'number'
```

This prevents mistakes early.

### Basic TypeScript Examples

#### 1. Adding Types to Variables

```ts
let username: string = "Hamza";
let age: number = 24;
let isAdmin: boolean = false;
```

#### 2. Object Types

```ts

type User = {
  id: number;
  name: string;
};

const user: User = {
  id: 1,
  name: "Hamza"
};
```

#### 3. Array Types

```ts
let scores: number[] = [10, 20, 30];
let names: string[] = ["Ali", "Hamza", "John"];
```
