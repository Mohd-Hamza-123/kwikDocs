## 🛠️ **Viewing Changes with `git diff`**

The `git diff` command shows the differences between various repository states.

1. Comparing Working Directory and Staging Area :
```bash
    git diff
```

2. Comparing Staging Area with Repository :
```bash
git diff --staged
```

3. Comparing Two Branches :
```bash
git diff <branch1>..<branch2>
```

4. Comparing Two Commits :

```bash
git diff <commit-hash-one> <commit-hash-two>
```

### How to Read the Diff Output

- `a/` – the original file (before changes)
- `b/` – the updated file (after changes)
- `---` – marks the beginning of the original file
- `+++` – marks the beginning of the updated file
- `@@` – shows the line numbers and position of changes

### 📋 Example Output:
```plaintext

diff --git a/main.py b/main.py
