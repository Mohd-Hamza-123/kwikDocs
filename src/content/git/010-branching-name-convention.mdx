Branching name conventions are important for maintaining a clean and organized Git repository. Here are some common conventions:


1. **General Guidelines**:
   - Use lowercase letters and hyphens (`-`) for readability.
   - Avoid special characters and keep names descriptive.
   - Include issue/ticket numbers if applicable.

2. **Common Patterns**:
   - **Work in Progress Branch**: `wip/<description>` (e.g., `wip/initial-setup`)
   - **Feature Branch**: `feature/<feature-name>` (e.g., `feature/add-user-auth`)
   - **Bugfix Branch**: `bugfix/<bug-description>` (e.g., `bugfix/fix-login-error`)
   - **Hotfix Branch**: `hotfix/<critical-fix>` (e.g., `hotfix/security-vulnerability`)
   - **Release Branch**: `release/<version>` (e.g., `release/1.0.0`)
   - **Epic Branch**: `epic/<epic-name>` (e.g., `epic/user-management-module`)
   - **Experiment Branch**: `experiment/<experiment-name>` (e.g., `experiment/test-caching`)
   - **Personal Branch**: `username/<branch-name>` (e.g., `hamza/refactor-cart`)

3. **Integration/Development**:
   - Use dedicated branches like `develop` or `integration` for ongoing or shared development.

4. **Benefits**:
   - Improves collaboration and clarity.
   - Links branches to tasks or issues in tools like Jira or GitHub.
