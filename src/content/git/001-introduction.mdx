### Overview
Git is a powerful version control system that tracks changes to your files. It is free, open-source software available for Windows, macOS, and Linux. Git is a tool you install on your system to help manage code versions efficiently.

### **What are Version Control Systems (VCS)?**

**Version control systems** are tools that help you track and manage the history of your code.  

Think of a VCS as a **checkpoint system** in a video game:  
- You can save your progress at specific points.  
- If needed, you can revert to a previous checkpoint.  

In software development, these checkpoints allow developers to:
- Recover older versions of the code.
- Experiment with changes without fear of losing the original work.
- Collaborate with others while maintaining a clean project history.

### **Git vs GitHub**

#### **Git**  
- A command-line tool that manages code versioning on your local machine.  
- It allows you to create, track, and modify repositories (projects).

#### **GitHub**  
- A **cloud-based hosting service** for Git repositories.  
- Provides an intuitive user interface for Git.  
- Enables collaboration with other developers by allowing you to:
  - Share your code.
  - Review and comment on changes.
  - Work together on projects remotely.

> **Key Difference**: Git is the tool, while GitHub is a platform to store and collaborate on projects created with Git.

### **Installing Git**

Git is available for all major operating systems. Follow these steps to install Git on your system:  

1. Visit the official Git website:  
   [https://git-scm.com/downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads)  

2. Download the version appropriate for your operating system:
   - **Windows**: Includes a simple installer.
   - **macOS**: Can be installed via Homebrew or Xcode Command Line Tools.
   - **Linux**: Install using your package manager (e.g., `apt`, `yum`, or `dnf`).

3. Follow the installation instructions provided by the installer.

4. Verify the installation:  
   Open your terminal or command prompt and run:  
   ```bash
   git --version
   ```

### **Check Git Version** :

To check if Git is installed correctly and to see the version you have, run the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

```bash
git --version
```

### **Why Use Git?**
- **Track Changes**: Keep a detailed history of what changed, when, and why.  
- **Collaboration**: Work with multiple developers on the same project seamlessly.  
- **Backup Code**: Safeguard your project by pushing it to a remote repository (e.g., GitHub).  
- **Experiment Safely**: Create branches for testing features without affecting the main codebase.
