Before you learn how to revert a commit, it's important to understand what is `HEAD`. 

#### What is HEAD?

HEAD is a reference to the most recent commit in your repository.

```plaintext {2}
PS E:\Rough\git-tutorial> git log --oneline
b883828 (HEAD -> master) third commit
698fa2e second commit
dd87246 initial commit
```

In this example, HEAD is pointing to the most recent commit, which is the third commit.


### Reverting a Commit

To revert a commit, you need to use the `git revert` command. 

```bash
git revert <COMMIT_ID>
```
