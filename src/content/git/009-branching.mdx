### What is Branching ?

Branching in Git is a feature that allows you to create separate lines of development within a repository. It is like a parallel version of your project where you can make changes without affecting the main codebase (typically the main or master branch).

### Why Branching is used
- **Isolate Development** : You can work on new features, bug fixes, or experiments without disturbing the main project.

- **Collaboration** : Developers can work on different branches simultaneously and independently, merging their work back into the main branch when ready.

- **Version Control** : Branches can represent different versions of the project, such as a release branch for deployment or a hotfix branch for emergency fixes.

- **Testing** : You can test changes on a separate branch before integrating them into the main codebase.

- **Organization** : Branches help keep the project organized by grouping related changes together.
