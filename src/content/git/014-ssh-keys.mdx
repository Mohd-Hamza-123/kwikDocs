SSH keys are a secure way to authenticate with a remote server. They allow you to securely connect to a server without entering a password every time.

### How to Generate an SSH Key

Open git bash and run the following command:
```bash
 ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
```
If you are using a legacy system that doesn't support the Ed25519 algorithm, use:

```bash
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"
```

This creates a new SSH key, using the provided email as a label.
