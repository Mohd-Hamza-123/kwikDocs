### 🚀 **Initializing a Git Repository**

#### 🔍 **Check If You Are in a Git Repository**
Before initializing, confirm whether you’re already inside a Git repository:

```bash
git status
```

If you are not in a Git repository, you'll see this message:  
```plaintext
fatal: not a git repository (or any of the parent directories): .git
```

---

### 🛠️ **Initialize a New Git Repository**
To initialize a directory as a Git repository:

1. **Navigate to the desired directory:**
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/your/project
   ```

2. **Run the following command:**
   ```bash
   git init
   ```

   📌 This will:
   - Create a hidden `.git` directory in the current folder.
   - Set up Git to track changes in the repository.

---

### 👀 **View the Hidden `.git` Directory**
Use the following command to see the `.git` folder:  

- **Windows (PowerShell):**
  ```bash
  Get-ChildItem -Force
  ```

- **Linux/Mac:**
  ```bash
  ls -a
  ```

---

### 📂 **Untracked Files**
🧷 After initializing, all files in the directory are **untracked** by default.  

Use the following command to check the status of untracked files:  
```bash
git status
```

💡 **Untracked files** are files not yet added to Git's version control system.

---

## ✏️ **Adding Files to Version Control**

To track a specific file, use:  
```bash
git add <FILE_PATH>
```

To add all files in the current directory:  
```bash
git add .
```

📋 After adding files, their status changes from **untracked** to **staged**.  
Verify the status of your repository:  
```bash
git status
```

## 🛠️ **Viewing Changes with `git diff`**

The `git diff` command shows the differences between various repository states.

### Usage:
- **Standard Diff Output:**  
  ```bash
  git diff
  ```

- **Bypass the pager (`less`) for direct output:**  
  ```bash
  git --no-pager diff
  ```

### 📋 Example Output:
```plaintext
warning: in the working copy of 'main.py', CRLF will be replaced by LF the next time Git touches it
diff --git a/main.py b/main.py
index d93a136..5fa4abc 100644
--- a/main.py
+++ b/main.py
@@ -1,5 +1,7 @@
 print("Hello World")
-
 def newFunction():
-    print("New Function")
+    print("Updated Function")
```

## ❌ **Removing Files from Version Control**

To remove a file from version control:  
```bash
git rm <FILE_PATH>
```

📌 **Note:**  
- The file will also be deleted from your working directory.  
- To keep the file locally but remove it from Git, use:  
  ```bash
  git rm --cached <FILE_PATH>
  ```
