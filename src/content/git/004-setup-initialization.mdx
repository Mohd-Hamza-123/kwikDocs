### Initializing an Existing Directory as a Git Repository

To initialize a directory as a Git repository, use the following command:

```bash
git init
```

- This will create a hidden `.git` directory in the current directory and initialize the repository.
- The `.git` directory contains all the metadata, configuration, and history of the repository.
- It tracks changes, branches, commits, and repository settings.

To view the hidden `.git` directory, use the following command:

```bash
Get-ChildItem -Force
```

Initially, any files in the directory are untracked.

### Adding Files to Version Control

To track a file, use the following command:

```bash
git add <FILE_PATH>
```

After the file is tracked:

## Viewing Changes with `git diff`

The `git diff` command shows differences between various states of the repository. It helps developers review changes.

### Usage

```bash
git diff
```

If the `git diff` output continues to display in the terminal (using a pager like `less`), press `q` to exit.

To bypass the pager and display the output directly, use:

```bash
git --no-pager diff
```

### Example Output

\ No newline at end of file

\ No newline at end of file
```

## Adding All Files to Version Control

To add all files in the current directory to version control, use the following command:

```bash
git add .
```

### Example

**Before Tracking:**

<ImageCenter src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dkkifg17t/image/upload/v1742309641/Documentarium/Git/qb0emmu9mevzsedwlr2n.png" alt="Untracked File" />

**After Tracking:**

### Removing Files from Version Control

To remove a file from version control, use the following command:

```bash
git rm <FILE_PATH>
```

This will delete the file from the repository and the working directory.
