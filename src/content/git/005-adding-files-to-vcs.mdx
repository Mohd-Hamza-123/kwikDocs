### 📂 **Untracked Files**
After initializing, all files in the directory are **untracked** by default.  

Use the following command to check the status of untracked files:  
```bash
git status
```

💡 **Untracked files** are files not yet added to Git's version control system.

---

### ✏️ **Adding Files to Version Control**

To track a specific file, use:  
```bash
git add <FILE_PATH>
```

To add all files in the current directory:  
```bash
git add .
```

📋 After adding files, their status changes from **untracked** to **staged**.  
Verify the status of your repository:  
```bash
git status
```

### ❌ **Removing Files from Version Control**

To remove a file from version control:  
```bash
git rm <FILE_PATH>
```

📌 **Note:**  
- The file will also be deleted from your working directory.  
- To keep the file locally but remove it from Git, use:  
  ```bash
  git rm --cached <FILE_PATH>
  ```
