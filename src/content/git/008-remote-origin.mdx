- A remote is a Git repository that your local Git project is connected to.

- Origin is the default name Git gives to that remote repository.

- You can have multiple remotes, but you can only have one origin.

#### Linking local Git repo to a remote repository 

```bash
git remote add origin <REMOTE_URL>
# `<REMOTE_URL>` is the URL of the remote repository (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, etc.).
```

#### Pushing local Git repo to a remote repository

```bash
git push -u origin <BRANCH_NAME>
# Example 
# git push -u origin main
# git push -u origin master
```

#### See remotes associated with your Git repository

```bash
git remote -v
# This will show you the remotes and their URLs.
# origin gitURL (fetch)
# origin gitURL (push)
```
