Commits in Git are snapshots of changes made to your codebase at a specific point in time. Each commit represents a saved state of your project, including a message describing the changes.

### Creating a Commit

To create a commit, follow these steps:

1. **Stage the changes**: Use the `git add` command to stage the files you want to include in the commit.
   ```bash
   git add <FILE_NAME>   # Stage a specific file
   git add .             # Stage all changes in the working directory
   ```

2. **Commit the changes**: Use the `git commit` command with a descriptive message.
   ```bash
   git commit -m "<MESSAGE>"
   ```

### Example:
```plaintext
PS E:\Rough\git-tutorial> git add .
PS E:\Rough\git-tutorial> git commit -m "Initial commit"
```

## Viewing Commit History

You can view the history of commits in your repository using the following commands:

### Detailed Commit History
```bash
git log
```

### Compact Commit History
```bash
git log --oneline
```

### Example:
```plaintext
PS E:\Rough\git-tutorial> git log

Author: Mohd Hamza <example@gmail.com>
Date:   Tue Mar 18 21:56:53 2025 +0530

    Initial commit
```

## Viewing Commit Details

To view the details of a specific commit, use the `git show` command:

```bash
git show <COMMIT_ID>
```

You can also display the output without paging using:
```bash
git --no-pager show <COMMIT_ID>
```

### Note:
You can use the first 7 characters of the commit ID instead of the full ID.

## Using `git blame`

The `git blame` command shows the history of a file line by line, indicating the commit that last modified each line.

### Syntax:
```bash
git blame <FILE_PATH>
```

### Example:
```plaintext
PS E:\Rough\git-tutorial> git blame main.py
698fa2ec (Mohd Hamza 2025-03-18 21:58:56 +0530 1) # tracking is enabled for all files in the current working directory
^dd87246 (Mohd Hamza 2025-03-18 21:56:53 +0530 2) def newFunction():
^dd87246 (Mohd Hamza 2025-03-18 21:56:53 +0530 3)     print("Tracking is enabled")
^dd87246 (Mohd Hamza 2025-03-18 21:56:53 +0530 4)     hello = "Hello World"
^dd87246 (Mohd Hamza 2025-03-18 21:56:53 +0530 5)     print(hello)
^dd87246 (Mohd Hamza 2025-03-18 21:56:53 +0530 6)
^dd87246 (Mohd Hamza 2025-03-18 21:56:53 +0530 7) newFunction()
```

## Using `git status`

The `git status` command shows the current status of your repository. It displays the number of files that have been modified, added, or deleted.

```bash
git status
```

Example output:
```plaintext
PS E:\Rough\git-tutorial> git status
On branch master
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
        modified:   core/config.py
        modified:   main.py

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
```

### Deleting Commits

```bash
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force .git
```

## Key Points About Commits:

- **Unique ID**: Each commit has a unique ID (SHA).
- **Descriptive Message**: Each commit includes a message describing the changes.
- **Author Information**: Commits are associated with a specific author.
- **Timestamp**: Commits are timestamped with the date and time they were made.
