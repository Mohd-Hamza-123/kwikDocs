title: Introduction to React Router
published: true

**React Router** is a **library for React** that lets you build **single-page applications (SPAs)** with **navigation and routing**.

Normally, in a plain React app:

* You only have one HTML file (`index.html`).
* React changes the UI inside a single page (no full-page reloads).
* But if you want multiple "pages" (like `/`, `/login`, `/dashboard`) you need a way to **map URLs to components**.

ðŸ‘‰ Thatâ€™s what React Router does:
It **listens to the URL** in the browser and **renders different React components** based on the current path.

### ðŸ”¹ Example without React Router

If you had no router, youâ€™d be stuck with conditional rendering:

```jsx
const App = () => {
  const [page, setPage] = useState("home");

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={() => setPage("home")}>Home</button>
      <button onClick={() => setPage("login")}>Login</button>

      {page === "home" && <h1>Home Page</h1>}
      {page === "login" && <h1>Login Page</h1>}
    </div>
  );
};
```

This works, but the **URL never changes** (always `/`), and you canâ€™t use the browserâ€™s back/forward buttons.


### ðŸ”¹ Key Benefits

* **SPA navigation** â†’ faster than reloading full pages.
* **Nested routes** (good for dashboards, layouts).
* **Dynamic routes** (like `/product/:id`).
* Works with **history API** (so browser buttons work).
* Makes large apps with multiple pages manageable.

ðŸ‘‰ In short:
**React Router is the standard way to do routing (multi-page navigation) in React apps.**
