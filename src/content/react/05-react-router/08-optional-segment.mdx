title : Optional Segment in react-router-dom
published : true
---

In **React Router DOM** (v6 and v7), an **optional segment** is a part of the route path that may or may not be present in the URL.

For example, suppose you have a route like:

```jsx
<Route path="/users/:id?" element={<User />} />
```

Here:

* `:id` is a **URL parameter**.
* The `?` makes it **optional**.

  * `/users` ✅ will match.
  * `/users/123` ✅ will also match.

**How it works**

* Without `?`, `/users` would not match `/users/:id`.
* With `?`, React Router accepts both cases.

**Example**

```jsx
import { BrowserRouter as Router, Routes, Route, useParams } from "react-router-dom";

function User() {
  const { id } = useParams();
  return <h1>{id ? `User ID: ${id}` : "No user selected"}</h1>;
}

export default function App() {
  return (
    <Router>
      <Routes>
        <Route path="/users/:id?" element={<User />} />
      </Routes>
    </Router>
  );
}
```

**Usage**

* `/users` → Renders: **"No user selected"**
* `/users/42` → Renders: **"User ID: 42"**
