In React, hooks have a few strict **rules** that you must follow so they work correctly. These are called the **Rules of Hooks**:


### 🔑 1. Only Call Hooks at the Top Level

* Don’t call hooks **inside loops, conditions, or nested functions**.
* Always call them at the top level of your component or custom hook.
  👉 This ensures React can keep the correct order of hook calls on every render.

✅ Correct:

```tsx
function MyComponent() {
  const [count, setCount] = React.useState(0); // ✅ always on top
  const id = React.useId();                    // ✅ consistent order

  if (count > 5) {
    console.log("Big number"); // ✅ logic inside condition, not hook
  }

  return <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>+</button>;
}
```

❌ Wrong:

```tsx
function MyComponent() {
  if (someCondition) {
    const [count, setCount] = React.useState(0); // ❌ breaks rules
  }
}
```


### 🔑 2. Only Call Hooks from React Functions

* Call hooks **only** from:

  * React function components
  * Custom hooks (functions starting with `use...`)

👉 Don’t call hooks from:

* Regular JavaScript functions
* Class components
* Event handlers (directly inside them)

✅ Correct:

```tsx
function useCounter() {     // ✅ custom hook
  const [count, setCount] = React.useState(0);
  return { count, setCount };
}

function MyComponent() {    // ✅ function component
  const { count, setCount } = useCounter();
  return <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>{count}</button>;
}
```

❌ Wrong:

```tsx
function notAComponent() {
  const [count, setCount] = React.useState(0); // ❌ not inside a component or custom hook
}
```


### 🔑 3. Follow the Hook Naming Convention

* Custom hooks must be named starting with `use` (e.g., `useForm`, `useFetch`, `useCounter`).
  👉 This helps React’s rules-of-hooks linter know if rules are being followed.


### 🔑 4. Same Order on Every Render

* Hooks must always be called in the **same order** every time a component renders.
  👉 React relies on this to match hook state with the right hook call.

### 🛠 Tooling

React provides **ESLint plugin** `eslint-plugin-react-hooks` which enforces:

* `react-hooks/rules-of-hooks` (checks rules #1 and #2)
* `react-hooks/exhaustive-deps` (checks hook dependency arrays)
