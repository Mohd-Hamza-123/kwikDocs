title : useFormStatus Hook
published : true
---

`useFormStatus` is a React 19 hook that **tells you if a form is currently submitting or not**.
It only works if you call it **inside a component that is a child of a `<form>`**.


ðŸ”¹ Simple Example

```tsx
// Parent component
import React from "react";
export default function MyForm() {
  // This function runs when the form is submitted
  async function handleSubmit(formData: FormData) {
    await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 2000)); // fake delay
    console.log("Submitted:", formData.get("name"));
  }

  return (
    <form action={handleSubmit}>
      <input type="text" name="name" placeholder="Your name" />
      <SubmitButton /> {/* child of <form>, so it works */}
    </form>
  );
}
```

```jsx
// Child component
import { useFormStatus } from "react-dom";

// A button that knows when the form is submitting
function SubmitButton() {
  const { pending } = useFormStatus(); // gets status of nearest <form>
  return (
    <button type="submit" disabled={pending}>
      {pending ? "Submitting..." : "Submit"}
    </button>
  );
}
```

ðŸ”¹ What happens

1. You type a name and click **Submit**.
2. The `handleSubmit` function runs (takes \~2 seconds here).
3. While itâ€™s running:

   * `useFormStatus().pending` becomes **true**.
   * The button text changes to **"Submitting..."**.
   * Button is disabled.
4. When done, it goes back to **"Submit"**.
