title : useTransition Hook
published : true
---

`useTransition` is a **React hook** that helps you mark some state updates as **“low priority”** (transitions).

👉 Example:

* Typing in a search box should feel instant.
* Filtering a huge list based on that text can be slow.
* `useTransition` lets you update the input immediately (urgent), and run the expensive filtering in the background (transition).

### ✅ Syntax of `useTransition`

```tsx
const [isPending, startTransition] = useTransition();
```

* **`isPending`** → `true` while the transition is running.
* **`startTransition(fn)`** → run `fn` as a transition (non-blocking).


```jsx
import React, { useState, useTransition } from "react";

export default function Search() {
  const [query, setQuery] = useState("");
  const [results, setResults] = useState([]);
  const [isPending, startTransition] = useTransition();

  function handleChange(e) {
    const value = e.target.value;
    setQuery(value);

    // expensive update runs as a transition
    startTransition(() => {
      const filtered = bigList.filter((item) =>
      // assume bigList is an array of 5000 items
        item.toLowerCase().includes(value.toLowerCase())
      );
      setResults(filtered);
    });
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <input value={query} onChange={handleChange} placeholder="Search..." />
      {isPending && <p>Loading...</p>}
      <ul>
        {results.map((r, i) => (
          <li key={i}>{r}</li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </div>
  );
}
```

👉 Typing feels smooth even with 5000 items, because React defers the heavy work.

### 🔹 `useFormStatus`

* Works only inside a **form’s child component**.
* Tells you whether a form is **submitting or idle** (`pending`).
* Powered by React’s new **form actions API** (React 19 / Next.js 13+).
* Example: disabling a **Submit button** while the form submits.

```tsx
import { useFormStatus } from "react-dom";

function SubmitButton() {
  const { pending } = useFormStatus();
  return (
    <button type="submit" disabled={pending}>
      {pending ? "Submitting..." : "Submit"}
    </button>
  );
}
```

# 🔹 Key Differences

| Feature           | `useTransition`                                            | `useFormStatus`                                        |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Scope**         | Any async or heavy state update                            | Only inside a `<form>`                                 |
| **Purpose**       | Mark updates as low-priority so UI stays responsive        | Track submission state of a form                       |
| **Return values** | `[isPending, startTransition]`                             | `{ pending, data, method, action }`                    |
| **Where used**    | Anywhere in React                                          | Inside a component nested in a `<form>`                |
| **Use case**      | Smooth UI during slow renders (e.g. filtering, navigation) | Disable buttons / show spinners when submitting a form |

🔹 Super Simple Analogy

* **`useTransition`** → “I want this update to feel smooth, even if it takes time.”
* **`useFormStatus`** → “I want to know if this form is submitting right now.”
