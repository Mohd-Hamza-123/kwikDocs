### 📖 **Official React Docs Definition of Hooks**

> *“Hooks are functions that let you ‘hook into’ React state and lifecycle features from function components. Hooks don’t work inside classes — they let you use React without classes.”*
> (From [React Docs](https://react.dev/reference/react))

**🟢 Simplified Version**

* Hooks are **special functions** from React.
* They allow **functional components** (not classes) to:

  * **store values** (`useState`)
  * **run code at specific times** (`useEffect`)
  * **share data** (`useContext`)
  * and more.

👉 Without hooks, functional components were just “dumb UI.”
👉 With hooks, functional components became **smart and powerful**.

### Some Hooks 

**List of important React hooks** and what they do.

#### 🔹 Basic Hooks

* **`useState`** → Lets a component **remember values** between renders (like a memory notebook).
* **`useEffect`** → Runs code **after React updates the screen** (good for fetching data, timers, subscriptions).
* **`useContext`** → Allows components to **read global data** without passing props manually.

---

#### 🔹 Additional Hooks

* **`useRef`** → Keeps a **value or DOM reference** that doesn’t reset on re-render.
* **`useReducer`** → Like `useState`, but for **more complex state logic** (similar to Redux-style reducers).
* **`useCallback`** → Remembers a **function** so it doesn’t get recreated every render.
* **`useMemo`** → Remembers a **calculated value** so it doesn’t get recalculated every render.
* **`useImperativeHandle`** → Lets you control what is exposed when using `ref` in a custom component.
* **`useLayoutEffect`** → Like `useEffect`, but runs **synchronously after DOM changes** (for measurements/DOM adjustments).
* **`useDebugValue`** → Helps label custom hooks for debugging in React DevTools.

---

#### 🔹 Newer/Advanced Hooks (React 18+)

* **`useId`** → Generates a **unique ID** that stays stable between renders (useful for accessibility).
* **`useTransition`** → Marks state updates as **non-urgent** (helps with performance for slow UI updates).
* **`useDeferredValue`** → Lets you **defer a value update** so the UI stays responsive.
* **`useSyncExternalStore`** → Used for subscribing to **external stores** (e.g., Redux, Zustand).
* **`useInsertionEffect`** → Special hook for **CSS-in-JS libraries** to insert styles before paint.

---

👉 In short:

* **State-related**: `useState`, `useReducer`
* **Side effects**: `useEffect`, `useLayoutEffect`, `useInsertionEffect`
* **Performance**: `useMemo`, `useCallback`
* **Refs/DOM**: `useRef`, `useImperativeHandle`
* **Concurrency (React 18)**: `useTransition`, `useDeferredValue`
* **Context/Stores**: `useContext`, `useSyncExternalStore`
