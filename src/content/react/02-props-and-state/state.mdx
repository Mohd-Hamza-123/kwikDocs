title: State

State is a way to store and manage data inside a component.  
Unlike props (which come from outside), **state is managed by the component itself** and can change over time.

```jsx
// Counter.jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react'

const Counter = () => {
  // Declare a state variable 'count' with initial value 0
  let [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Count: {count}</h2>
      {/* Update state using setCount */}
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count - 1)}>Decrement</button>
    </div>
  )
}

export default Counter
```

### âœ… Key Points about State

* State is **data that belongs to a component**.
* State can **change over time** (e.g., user input, button clicks).
* When state changes, the component **re-renders automatically**.
* State is created using the **`useState` hook** in functional components.
* Unlike props, **a component can update its own state**.
