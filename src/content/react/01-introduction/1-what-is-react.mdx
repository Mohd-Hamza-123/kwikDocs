React is a JavaScript library developed by Facebook (now Meta) for building user interfaces. It allows developers to create reusable UI components that efficiently update when data changes, using a virtual DOM for optimal performance.

### Key Features

- **Component-Based Architecture**: Build encapsulated components that manage their own state
- **Virtual DOM**: Efficiently updates the UI by minimizing direct DOM manipulation
- **JSX Syntax**: Combines HTML-like syntax with JavaScript functionality
- **Unidirectional Data Flow**: Makes code more predictable and easier to debug
- **Rich Ecosystem**: Extensive libraries, tools, and community support
