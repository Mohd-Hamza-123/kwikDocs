To install React, you need to have Node.js installed on your machine. You can download Node.js from the [official website](https://nodejs.org/).

### Using Vite (Recommended)

Vite provides a faster and leaner development experience for modern web projects. Create a new React project with Vite using:

```bash
npm create vite@latest my-react-app --template react
```

Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

> If you encounter an error stating 'vite' is not recognized, run `npm install vite` first.
