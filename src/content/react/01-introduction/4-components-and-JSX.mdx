title: Components & JSX

Components are the building blocks of React applications. Think of them like LEGO pieces that you can combine to build a complete user interface. Each component is a reusable piece of code that represents a part of your user interface.

### Types of Components

#### 1. Function Components

The modern and recommended way to write components. They are simple JavaScript functions that return JSX.

```jsx
function Greeting() {
  return <h1>Hello, World!</h1>;
}
```

#### 2. Class Components

The traditional way to define components using JavaScript classes.

```jsx
class Greeting extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <h1>Hello, World!</h1>;
  }
}
```

#### Use of Components 

To use a component, first you need to import it into your file. Then, you can use it in your JSX code by calling it as a function or by using it as a class.

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import Greeting from './Greeting';

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Greeting />
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

```jsx
import React from 'react';

class App extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <Greeting />
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```

#### Components vs Function 


1. **Function (in JavaScript)**

* A function is just plain JavaScript â€” it takes input (parameters) and returns an output.
* Example:

```js
function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
```

* It has nothing to do with React unless you explicitly make it return **React elements**.


2. **React Component**

* A React component **is a special kind of function (or class)** that **returns JSX (React elements)**.
* React uses these components to build the UI.
* Example:

```jsx
function Greeting() {
  return <h1>Hello, World!</h1>;  // returns JSX
}
```

* React components must:

  * Start with a **capital letter** (e.g., `Greeting`, not `greeting`).
  * Return JSX (or `null`) that React can render.

ðŸ‘‰ In short:
**Every React component is a function, but not every function is a React component.**

### What is JSX?

JSX (JavaScript XML) is a syntax extension for JavaScript that looks similar to HTML. It makes writing React components more intuitive.

### JSX Basics

- JSX is a `syntax extension` for JavaScript that lets you write HTML-like code in your JavaScript
- It gets transformed into regular JavaScript during the build process
- It makes your React code more readable and easier to write

```jsx
// This is JSX
const element = <h1>Hello, JSX!</h1>;

// It gets transformed into something like this
const element = React.createElement('h1', null, 'Hello, JSX!');
```

### JSX Rules

1. **Every JSX element must be closed**
```jsx
   <img src="image.jpg" /> {/* Self-closing tag */}
   <div>Content</div> {/* Regular closing tag */}
```

2. **Return a single root element**
```jsx
   // Correct - Single root element
   return (
     <div>
       <h1>Title</h1>
       <p>Paragraph</p>
     </div>
   );

   // Also correct - Using Fragment
   return (
     <>
       <h1>Title</h1>
       <p>Paragraph</p>
     </>
   );
```

3. **Use camelCase for attributes**

```jsx
   <div className="container" onClick={handleClick}></div>
```

4. **Embed JavaScript expressions with curly braces**

```jsx
   const name = "React";
   return <h1>Hello, {name}!</h1>;
```
