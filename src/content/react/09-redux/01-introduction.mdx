### What is Redux?

Redux is a **state management library** for JavaScript apps (mostly React).

* It keeps your appâ€™s **global state** (data that multiple components need) in one central **store**.
* Instead of passing props around deeply, components can read from or update the store directly.
* It uses a predictable flow:

  1. A **component dispatches an action** â†’
  2. A **reducer** updates the state â†’
  3. The **UI re-renders** with new data.

ðŸ‘‰ Think of Redux as a **single source of truth** for your app state.

### ðŸ”¹ When to Use Redux

Redux is helpful when your appâ€™s state management becomes **too complex** for just Reactâ€™s `useState` and `useContext`.

You should consider Redux if:

* Your app has **lots of global state** (auth, theme, cart, notifications, etc.).
* Multiple components need to access or update the same data.
* You need **predictability** (time-travel debugging, logging, undo/redo).
* Your appâ€™s state update logic is complex (merging, transformations, async updates like API calls).
* You want **structured & scalable** state management for a **big project** with multiple developers.

ðŸ‘‰ Examples:

* E-commerce cart system
* Authentication across pages
* Dashboards with filters + charts sharing data
* Real-time apps with notifications

### ðŸ”¹ When **NOT** to Use Redux

Redux adds **extra boilerplate** (though Redux Toolkit makes it easier). If your app is small, Redux might be **overkill**.

You probably donâ€™t need Redux if:

* The app is small (a todo list, a form, a portfolio site).
* State is mostly local to individual components.
* Reactâ€™s built-in state (`useState`, `useReducer`, `useContext`) is enough.
* Youâ€™re not managing complex global data.

ðŸ‘‰ In many cases, **React Query (TanStack Query)** or **Zustand** can replace Redux for async data fetching and simpler state management.


**Summary**

* **Redux = predictable global state management**
* **Use it**: Large, complex apps with lots of shared state
* **Skip it**: Small apps, or if `useState`/`useContext` is enough
