# 🧮 Comparison Operators  

In JavaScript, comparison operators are used to compare two values and return a boolean (`true` or `false`) based on the comparison.  

## 📋 Main Comparison Operators  

### 1️⃣ **Equality (`==`)**  
Compares two values for equality, converting types if necessary (loose equality).  

```javascript
// Equality (==)
console.log(5 == '5'); // true (loose equality, type conversion happens)
console.log(5 == 5);   // true
```

Example:  
`5 == '5'` → `true`  

---

### 2️⃣ **Strict Equality (`===`)**  
Compares both the value and the type for equality (no type conversion).  

```javascript
// Strict Equality (===)
console.log(5 === '5'); // false (strict equality, no type conversion)
console.log(5 === 5);   // true
```

Example:  
`5 === '5'` → `false`  

---

### 3️⃣ **Inequality (`!=`)**  
Checks if two values are not equal, with type conversion.  

```javascript
// Inequality (!=)
console.log(5 != '6'); // true (type conversion happens)
console.log(5 != '5'); // false (values are the same after conversion)
```

Example:  
`5 != '6'` → `true`  

---

### 4️⃣ **Strict Inequality (`!==`)**  
Checks if values or types are not equal.  

```javascript
// Strict Inequality (!==)
console.log(5 !== '5'); // true (type and value are different)
console.log(5 !== 5);   // false (both type and value are the same)
```

Example:  
`5 !== '5'` → `true`  

---

### 5️⃣ **Greater Than (`>`)**  
Checks if the left value is greater than the right.  

```javascript
// Greater Than (>)
console.log(7 > 5); // true (7 is greater than 5)
console.log(5 > 7); // false
```

Example:  
`7 > 5` → `true`  

---

### 6️⃣ **Less Than (`<`)**  
Checks if the left value is less than the right.  

```javascript
// Less Than (<)
console.log(3 < 5); // true (3 is less than 5)
console.log(5 < 3); // false
```

Example:  
`3 < 5` → `true`  

---

### 7️⃣ **Greater Than or Equal To (`>=`)**  
Checks if the left value is greater than or equal to the right.  

```javascript
// Greater Than or Equal To (>=)
console.log(5 >= 5); // true (5 is equal to 5)
console.log(7 >= 5); // true (7 is greater than 5)
```

Example:  
`5 >= 5` → `true`  

---

### 8️⃣ **Less Than or Equal To (`<=`)**  
Checks if the left value is less than or equal to the right.  

```javascript
// Less Than or Equal To (<=)
console.log(3 <= 5); // true (3 is less than 5)
console.log(5 <= 5); // true (5 is equal to 5)
```

Example:  
`3 <= 5` → `true`
