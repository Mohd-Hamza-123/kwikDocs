Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables in JavaScript. The most common is the simple `=` operator, but JavaScript also provides **compound assignment operators** that combine arithmetic with assignment.

### Basic Assignment Operator

| Operator | Description                 | Example         | Result          |
|----------|-----------------------------|------------------|------------------|
| `=`      | Assigns a value             | `x = 10`         | `x` is `10`      |


```js
let x;
x = 5;
console.log(x); // Output: 5
```

### Compound Assignment Operators

These operators perform an operation and assignment in a single step.

| Operator | Equivalent To | Description               |
| -------- | ------------- | ------------------------- |
| `+=`     | `x = x + y`   | Addition assignment       |
| `-=`     | `x = x - y`   | Subtraction assignment    |
| `*=`     | `x = x * y`   | Multiplication assignment |
| `/=`     | `x = x / y`   | Division assignment       |
| `%=`     | `x = x % y`   | Modulus assignment        |
| `**=`    | `x = x ** y`  | Exponentiation assignment |


#### 1. `+=` (Addition Assignment)

```js
let a = 10;
a += 5; // Same as: a = a + 5
console.log(a); // Output: 15
```

#### 2. `-=` (Subtraction Assignment)

```js
let b = 20;
b -= 7; // b = b - 7
console.log(b); // Output: 13
```

#### 3. `*=` (Multiplication Assignment)

```js
let c = 4;
c *= 3; // c = c * 3
console.log(c); // Output: 12
```

#### 4. `/=` (Division Assignment)

```js
let d = 12;
d /= 3; // d = d / 3
console.log(d); // Output: 4
```

#### 5. `%=` (Modulus Assignment)

```js
let e = 10;
e %= 3; // e = e % 3
console.log(e); // Output: 1
```

#### 6. `**=` (Exponentiation Assignment)

```js
let f = 2;
f **= 3; // f = f ** 3
console.log(f); // Output: 8
```
