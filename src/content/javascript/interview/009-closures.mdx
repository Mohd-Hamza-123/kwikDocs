A **closure** is created when a function remembers its outer variables even after the outer function has finished executing.

**Example:**

```javascript
function outerFunction(outerVariable) {
    return function innerFunction(innerVariable) {
        console.log(`Outer: ${outerVariable}, Inner: ${innerVariable}`);
    };
}
const closureFunc = outerFunction("outside");
closureFunc("inside"); // Output: Outer: outside, Inner: inside
```
