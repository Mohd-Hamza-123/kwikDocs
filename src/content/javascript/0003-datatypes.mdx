#### JavaScript Data Types

JavaScript is a dynamically typed language, meaning variables are not directly associated with any specific data type. Instead, the data type is determined by the value assigned to the variable at runtime.

#### Primitive Data Types

These are immutable and represent a single value:

#### 1. String
Represents a sequence of characters.

```js
let name = "John";
console.log(typeof name);
 // "string"
