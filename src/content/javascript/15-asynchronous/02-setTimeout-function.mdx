title: setTimeout Function
published: true
---

The `setTimeout()` function in JavaScript is used to **delay the execution** of a piece of code. It runs a function **once** after a specified amount of time (in milliseconds).


### 🧪 Syntax

```js
setTimeout(callback, delay);
```

* `callback` → The function to run after the delay.
* `delay` → Time in **milliseconds** (1000 ms = 1 second).

---

**Example**

```js
console.log("Start");

setTimeout(() => {
  console.log("This runs after 2 seconds");
}, 2000);

console.log("End");
```

🧾 **Output:**

```
Start
End
This runs after 2 seconds
```

> JavaScript doesn't wait for `setTimeout()` to finish—it continues running the code and comes back to the callback later.

---

**Example with Named Function**

```js
function greet() {
  console.log("Hello after 1 second");
}

setTimeout(greet, 1000);
```

### 🧠 Things to Know

* `setTimeout()` is **asynchronous**—it doesn't block the rest of the code.
* The actual delay is **not guaranteed**; it depends on how busy the JavaScript engine is.
* You can **cancel** a timeout using `clearTimeout()`.

---

### ❌ Cancel a Timeout with `clearTimeout()`

```js
const timerId = setTimeout(() => {
  console.log("This will not run");
}, 3000);

clearTimeout(timerId);
```

🧾 Nothing will be printed because the timeout was cancelled.

---

### 🧾 Real-World Use Cases

* Showing a notification after a short delay.
* Delaying a redirect or animation.
* Simulating network delays in testing.
