title: Synchronous vs Asynchronous JavaScript

### üîπ What is **Synchronous JavaScript**?

In **synchronous** code:

* Tasks are executed **one after another**.
* Each line **waits** for the previous one to finish before running.
* This is the default behavior in JavaScript.

**Example:**

```js
console.log("Start");
console.log("Middle");
console.log("End");
```

üßæ **Output:**

```
Start
Middle
End
```

Every line runs **in order**, one after the other.

### üî∏ What is **Asynchronous JavaScript**?

In **asynchronous** code:

* Some tasks (like timers, HTTP requests, or reading files) **do not block** the main thread.
* JavaScript can **keep running other code** while waiting for tasks like timers or server responses to finish.

**Example using `setTimeout`:**

```js
console.log("Start");

setTimeout(() => {
  console.log("Inside Timeout");
}, 1000);

console.log("End");
```

üßæ **Output:**

```
Start
End
Inside Timeout
```

*(after \~1 second delay)*

### üé® Visual Analogy

* **Synchronous**: You stand in line at a ticket counter. You can't move forward until the person ahead is done.
* **Asynchronous**: You take a token and sit down. When your turn comes, you're called back without blocking others.

### üß™ Common Asynchronous Tools in JS

| Feature         | Description                              |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `setTimeout()`  | Runs code after a delay                  |
| `setInterval()` | Runs code repeatedly with delay          |
| `fetch()`       | Makes HTTP requests (returns Promise)    |
| `Promise`       | Handles async operations and chaining    |
| `async/await`   | Cleaner syntax for working with Promises |

| Feature            | Synchronous                       | Asynchronous                                    |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Execution Order    | Line-by-line, blocking            | Non-blocking, skips to next task                |
| Blocks other code? | ‚úÖ Yes                             | ‚ùå No                                            |
| Real-world example | Reading a large file line-by-line | Downloading a file in background                |
| Common tools       | Regular JS code                   | `setTimeout`, `fetch`, `Promise`, `async/await` |
