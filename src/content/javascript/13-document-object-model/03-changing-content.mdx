title: Changing Content
published: true

In JavaScript, there are several ways to change or update the content of the DOM (Document Object Model).

### ✅ 1. `innerHTML`

Changes HTML content (can include tags):

```js
element.innerHTML = "<b>Hello</b>";
```

---

### ✅ 2. `textContent`

Changes only the text (ignores tags):

```js
element.textContent = "Hello World";
```

---

### ✅ 3. `innerText`

Changes visible text (similar to `textContent`, but considers CSS):

```js
element.innerText = "Hi there!";
```

---

### ✅ 4. `value`

Used for form inputs:

```js
inputElement.value = "New input text";
```
