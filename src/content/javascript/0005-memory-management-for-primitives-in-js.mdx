description: JS Variables are container for storing values

1)
```js
    let age = 55; // 'age' is a variable that holds the value 55
    
    let x = age;  // 'x' now holds a copy of the value of 'age'
  ```

### Key Points:

*   Primitive values are **copied by value**, not by reference.
*   Each variable gets its **own memory space** with a copy of the value.
*   **Primitive values (like numbers, strings etc)** are compared by value not compared by reference (memory location)

2)
```js
    let name = 'Darkseid';
    console.log(name); // 'Darkseid'
    
    name = 'Mohd Hamza'; // A new memory location is created
    console.log(name); // 'Mohd Hamza'
    
    // 'Darkseid' remains in memory until garbage collected
```
