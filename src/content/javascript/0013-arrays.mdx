In JavaScript, **arrays** are special objects that are used to store multiple values in a single variable. They are ordered collections of data, where each value (called an element) is identified by an **index**.

```javascript
const arr = [10, 20, 30];

const fruits = ["Apple", "Banana", "Cherry"];

const veggies = ["Carrot", "Tomato"];
```

### **Accessing Elements**

Use the index to access an element.

```javascript
const fruits = ["Apple", "Banana", "Cherry"];
console.log(fruits[0]); // Output: "Apple"
console.log(fruits[2]); // Output: "Cherry"
```

### **Modifying Elements**

You can update an element by assigning a value to its index.

```javascript
const fruits = ["Apple", "Banana", "Cherry"];
fruits[1] = "Mango";
console.log(fruits); // Output: ["Apple", "Mango", "Cherry"]
```

### **Deleting Elements**

Use the `delete` operator to delete an element. However, this leaves an empty slot, and the array's length remains unchanged.

```javascript
const fruits = ["Apple", "Mango", "Banana", "Lichi", "Tomato"];

delete fruits[4];

console.log(fruits);
// Output: ["Apple", "Mango", "Banana", "Lichi", empty]
console.log(fruits.length);
// Output: 5

fruits.length = 4;

console.log(fruits);
// Output: ["Apple", "Mango", "Banana", "Lichi"]
console.log(fruits.length);
// Output: 4
```

> **Note:** Adjusting the `length` property can truncate or expand an array, but modifying elements directly is preferred for maintaining consistency.
