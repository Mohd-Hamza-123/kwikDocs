title: Deleting Documents

In Firestore, there are multiple ways to delete documents. Let’s cover **all possible methods** 

### 1. **Delete a Single Document (by ID)**

If you know the document ID:

```js
import { doc, deleteDoc } from "firebase/firestore";
import { db } from "./firebase"; // your firestore config

// delete one document
await deleteDoc(doc(db, "users", "USER_ID"));
```

This removes the document (and all its fields) but does **not** automatically delete subcollections inside it.


### 2. **Delete Multiple Documents (Query + Delete Loop)**

If you want to delete documents based on a field or condition:

```js
import { collection, query, where, getDocs, deleteDoc, doc } from "firebase/firestore";

// Example: delete all users where age < 18
const q = query(collection(db, "users"), where("age", "<", 18));
const snapshot = await getDocs(q);

snapshot.forEach(async (docSnap) => {
  await deleteDoc(doc(db, "users", docSnap.id));
});
```


### 3. **Delete All Documents in a Collection**

Firestore does **not allow deleting a whole collection in one API call**.
You must iterate through the documents:

```js
import { collection, getDocs, deleteDoc, doc } from "firebase/firestore";

const colRef = collection(db, "users");
const snapshot = await getDocs(colRef);

snapshot.forEach(async (docSnap) => {
  await deleteDoc(doc(db, "users", docSnap.id));
});
```

⚡ For large collections, it’s better to use **Firebase Admin SDK** with **batch writes** or **recursive deletes**.


### 4. **Delete a Document with Batch**

If you want to delete multiple documents in one go:

```js
import { writeBatch, doc } from "firebase/firestore";
import { db } from "./firebase";

const batch = writeBatch(db);

batch.delete(doc(db, "users", "USER_ID_1"));
batch.delete(doc(db, "users", "USER_ID_2"));
batch.delete(doc(db, "users", "USER_ID_3"));

await batch.commit();
```


### 5. **Delete with Firebase Admin SDK (Server-Side)**

If you're using Firebase Admin (Node.js backend):

```js
import admin from "firebase-admin";

const db = admin.firestore();

// Delete one doc
await db.collection("users").doc("USER_ID").delete();

// Delete with condition
const snapshot = await db.collection("users").where("active", "==", false).get();
snapshot.forEach(async (doc) => {
  await doc.ref.delete();
});
```

### 6. **Recursive Delete (Delete Document + All Subcollections)**

Subcollections are **not deleted automatically**. You need Firebase Admin SDK’s recursive delete (or Firebase CLI):

```bash
firebase firestore:delete users/USER_ID --recursive
```

Or programmatically (Node.js Admin SDK):

```js
import { getFirestore } from "firebase-admin/firestore";
import { deleteCollection } from "firebase-admin/firestore";

const db = getFirestore();

await db.recursiveDelete(db.doc("users/USER_ID"));
```


✅ **Summary of All Ways**

1. Delete one document by ID → `deleteDoc(doc(...))`
2. Delete multiple docs by query → `getDocs(query) + deleteDoc`
3. Delete all docs in a collection → loop all docs + delete
4. Batch delete → `writeBatch().delete()`
5. Server-side delete with Admin SDK → `db.collection(...).doc(...).delete()`
6. Recursive delete (doc + subcollections) → Admin SDK or Firebase CLI
