title: Get Current User in Firebase
published: true
---

```js
import { onAuthStateChanged } from "firebase/auth";
import { firebaseAuth } from "./firebase"; // Your firebase configuration

onAuthStateChanged(firebaseAuth, (user) => {
  if (user) {
    console.log("User is signed in:", user);
    console.log("UID:", user.uid);
    console.log("Email:", user.email);
  } else {
    console.log("User is signed out");
  }
});
```

* This runs whenever the user logs in, logs out, or when Firebase restores the session after a refresh.
* Most apps use onAuthStateChanged once (in a global state, Redux/Zustand/Context) to track the current user and provide it to the whole app.
