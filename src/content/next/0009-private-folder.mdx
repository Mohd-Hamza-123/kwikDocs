### 🗂️ **Private Folders**  
**Description:** Private folders in Next.js are created by prefixing a folder name with an underscore (`_`), such as `_folderName`. This indicates that the folder is a private implementation detail and should not be considered by the routing system. Consequently, the folder and all its subfolders are excluded from routing.  

📸 **Example:**

In the image above, `_css` and its subfolder are private folders. These are **ignored** by the routing system.
