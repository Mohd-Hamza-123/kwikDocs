## Server Component 

Server components execute only on the server. By default every component is a server component. Unless you explicitly mark a component as a client component.

```tsx
export default function ServerComponent() {
    return <h1>This is a server component</h1>
}
```

### **When to Use Server Components**
Server Components run on the server. Use them when your component:

1. **Fetches Data on the Server:**
   - Needs to access a database, call an API, or fetch static content before rendering.

2. **Doesnâ€™t Require Interactivity:**
   - Displays static or dynamic content without user interactions (e.g., blog posts, product descriptions).

3. **Needs Better Performance:**
   - Offloads heavy computations or large data processing to the server.

4. **Requires Secure Data Handling:**
   - Handles sensitive operations like fetching private user data or secure API calls.

5. **Focuses on SEO:**
   - Outputs fully-rendered HTML for search engines to crawl.


## Client Component

Client components execute on the server as well as on the client. Client component first executes on the server and then on the client.

```tsx
'use client'
export default function ClientComponent() {
    return <h1>This is a client component</h1>
}
```

### **When to Use Client Components**
Client Components run in the browser. Use them when your component:

1. **Needs Interactivity:**
   - Includes user interactions like forms, buttons, or dropdowns.
   - Uses browser-specific APIs like `localStorage`, `window`, or `document`.

2. **Relies on State or Effects:**
   - Manages local state with hooks like `useState` or `useReducer`.
   - Uses `useEffect` for side effects like fetching data from an API on the client side.

3. **Requires Animation:**
   - Implements animations using libraries like Framer Motion or CSS transitions.

4. **Handles Client-Side Data Fetching:**
   - Fetches data after the page loads, such as infinite scrolling or client-side search.

5. **Depends on Real-Time Updates:**
   - Uses WebSockets, subscriptions, or polling for live data (e.g., chat apps, dashboards).

<Callout>
If you mark a parent component with "use client", all of its child components automatically inherit the client-side behavior, regardless of whether "use client" is explicitly specified in the child components or not.
