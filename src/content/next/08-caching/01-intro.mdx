Next.js improves your application's performance and reduces costs by caching rendering work and data requests. 

> Rendering work is everything Next.js does to turn your React code + data into the final HTML of the page.


### Important Points 

* By default, Next.js will cache as much as possible to improve performance and reduce cost. This means routes are statically rendered and data requests are cached unless you opt out.
