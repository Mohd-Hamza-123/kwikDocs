**Route Groups** in Next.js are a feature of the `app` directory that allows you to group files and directories without impacting the URL structure of your application.

### 📂 Example Folder Structure:

```plaintext
app/
├── (dashboard)/            // Route group for dashboard-specific routes
│   ├── layout.tsx          // Shared layout for dashboard routes
│   ├── home/
│   │   ├── page.tsx        // URL: /home
│   ├── analytics/
│   │   ├── page.tsx        // URL: /analytics
```
