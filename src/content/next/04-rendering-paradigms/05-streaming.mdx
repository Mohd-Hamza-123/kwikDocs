Streaming is a data transfer technique that allows you to break down a route into smaller "chunks" and progressively stream them from the server to the client as they become ready. This can be useful for large pages that take a long time to generate, as it allows the client to start rendering the page before the entire page has been generated.

How to Use Streaming in Next.js

## 1) Suspense in Components

Wrap components with `<Suspense>` to specify fallback content while the main content loads.

```tsx
import { Suspense } from 'react';

export default function Page() {
    return (
        <div>
            <h1>Welcome to My Page</h1>
            <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading content...</div>}>
                <MyAsyncComponent />
            </Suspense>
        </div>
    );
}
```
