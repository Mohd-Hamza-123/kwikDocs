title: Handle loading state while fetching data 
published: true

Suppose you are fetching some data on server component

```tsx
const Posts = async ()=> {
     const response = await fetch(`API_URL`)
     const todos = await response.json()
     return <div>{todos}</div>
}
export default Posts
```

To handle loading State make a loading.tsx file parallel to the component you want to load.

```tsx
const loading = () => {
    return <p> Please wait... </p>
}
export default loading;
```
