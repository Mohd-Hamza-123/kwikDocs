Hydration is the process of attaching event listeners and state to the server-rendered HTML. It involves adding interactivity to pre-rendered HTML to make it dynamic and functional.

### How Hydration Works

1. **Server Pre-Renders HTML**:
   - During Server-Side Rendering (SSR) or Static Site Generation (SSG), the server generates an HTML file for the page.
   - This pre-rendered HTML is sent to the browser.

2. **React Hydrates the HTML**:
   - The browser downloads the JavaScript bundle for the page.
   - React "hydrates" the server-rendered HTML by attaching event listeners and enabling interactivity.

3. **Result**:
   - The page becomes fully interactive, with React taking over control of the UI and enabling dynamic behavior.
