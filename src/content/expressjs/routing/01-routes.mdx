**Routing** in Express means defining **how your application responds** to different HTTP requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) made to different **URLs (paths)**.

* The `app.get("/", ...)` tells Express:

  * When a client makes a `GET` request to `/` (the root path),
  * Run this function (the route handler),
  * And return a response.

**Example (different routes)**

```js
import express from "express";
const app = express();

app.get("/", (req, res) => {
  res.json({ message: "Home route" });
  // type localhost:3000 in your browser address bar and see the result
});

app.get("/about", (req, res) => {
  res.json({ message: "About route" });
  // type localhost:3000/about in your browser address bar and see the result
});

app.post("/contact", (req, res) => {
  res.json({ message: "Contact form submitted" });
});

app.listen(3000, () => console.log("Server running on 3000"));
```

Here you have **three routes**:

* `GET /` → Home route
* `GET /about` → About route
* `POST /contact` → Contact route
