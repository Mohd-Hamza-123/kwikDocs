title: Configuring JSON
published: true

When building an Express.js server, you often need to handle data sent in **JSON format** from the client.  
Express provides a built-in middleware `express.json()` to make this easy.

**Usage** 

```js
import express from "express";

const app = express();

// Parse JSON request bodies
app.use(express.json());
```

Now, whenever a client sends a request with a JSON body, it will be automatically parsed and available in `req.body`.

---

### Setting a Size Limit

By default, Express allows JSON bodies up to **100kb** in size.
To prevent large or malicious requests, you can set a custom limit:

```js
app.use(express.json({ limit: "16kb" }));
```

* ✅ Parses JSON up to **16kb**
* ❌ Rejects larger payloads with `413 Payload Too Large`

---

**Example**

```js
app.post("/data", (req, res) => {
  console.log(req.body); // Parsed JSON
  res.send("Data received!");
});
```

If the client sends:

```json
{
  "name": "Hamza",
  "role": "developer"
}
```

It will be accessible in `req.body`.

### Why Add a Limit?

* Protects your server from **DoS attacks** where huge requests could crash it.
* Keeps requests lightweight and efficient.
