Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is a mechanism that allows restricted resources on a web page to be requested from another domain outside the domain from which the first resource was served.


### 1) Install the `cors` package

```bash
npm install cors
```


### 2) Configure CORS

In your application, configure CORS using the `cors` package:

```ts
import express from "express";
import cors from "cors";

const app = express();

app.use(
  cors({
    origin: "http://localhost:8000", // or your frontend URL use "*" for all
    methods: ["GET", "POST", "PUT", "DELETE"],
    credentials: true, // if using cookies/auth headers
  })
);

app.get("/", (req, res) => {
  res.json({ message: "Hello World" });
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log("Server running on http://localhost:3000");
});
```
