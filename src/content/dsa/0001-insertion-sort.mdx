Insertion sort works by **dividing the array into "sorted" and "unsorted" part.**

_Lets Take an Array :_

**8**

**14**

**2**

**5**

**1**

Assume the first element is considered as sorted. And rest elements are considered as unsorted.

**8**

**14**

**2**

**5**

**1**

**1st Pass :** 

**i)** Now we will insert **14** into sorted array.  Since 8 is less than 14 so there is no need to shift 8 . Now Array will look like this 

**8**

**14**

**2**

**5**

**1**

**2nd Pass :** 

**i)** Now we will insert 2 into sorted part of array. First we compare 2 with 14 , Since 14 is greater than 2, we shift 14 to the right to make space for 2. Now Array will look like this  \[ 8 , 2 , 14 , 5 , 1 \].

**ii)** Now we will compare 2 with 8 , since 8 is greater than 2 , we will shift 8 to the right to make space for 2 . After shifting array will look like this 

\[ 2 , 8 , 14 , 5 , 1 \]

**2**

**8**

**14**

**5**

**1**

**3rd Pass :** 

**i)** Now we will insert 5 into sorted part of array. Since 14 is greater than 5 , we will shift 14  . Array will be \[ 2 , 8 , 5 , 14 , 1 \]

**ii)** Now we will compare 5 with 8 , since 8 is greater than 5 . We will shift 8 . Array will be \[ 2 , 5 , 8 , 14 , 1 \]

**iii)** Now we will compare 5 with 2 , since 2 is less than 5 no need to shift . Array will be \[ 2 , 5 , 8 , 14 , 1\] 

**2**

**5**

**8**

**14**

**1**

**4th Pass :** 

**i )**   Now we will insert 1 into sorted part of array. Since 14 is greater than 1 , we will shift 14 . Array will be \[ 2 , 5 , 8 , 1 , 14 \]

**ii )**  Now compare 1 with 8 . Since 8 is greater than 1 , we will shift 8 . Array will be \[ 2 , 5 , 1 , 8 , 14 \]

**iii )** Now compare 1 with 5. Since 5 is greater than 1 , we will shift 5  . Array will be \[ 2 , 1 , 5 , 8 , 14 \]

**iv )** Now compare 1 with 2 . Since 2 is greater than 1 , we will shift 2 . Array will be \[ 1 , 2 , 5 , 8 , 14 \] 

**Now the Array is Sorted Array :** 

**1**

**2**

**5**

**8**

**14**
```c
    #include <stdio.h>
    
    // Function to perform insertion sort
    void insertionSort(int arr[], int n) {
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            int key = arr[i];
            int j = i - 1;
    
            // Move elements of arr[0..i-1], that are greater than key,
            // to one position ahead of their current position
            while (j >= 0 && arr[j] > key) {
                arr[j + 1] = arr[j];
                j = j - 1;
            }
            arr[j + 1] = key;
        }
    }
    
    // Function to print the array
    void printArray(int arr[], int n) {
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            printf("%d ", arr[i]);
        }
        printf("\n");
    }
    
    int main() {
        int arr[] = {12, 11, 13, 5, 6};
        int n = sizeof(arr) / sizeof(arr[0]);
    
        printf("Original array: \n");
        printArray(arr, n);
    
        insertionSort(arr, n);
    
        printf("Sorted array: \n");
        printArray(arr, n);
    
        return 0;
    }
