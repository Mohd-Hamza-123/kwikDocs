### Implicit Type Conversion (or Automatic/Widening Conversion,Coercion)

This refers to the conversion of one data type to another data type that happens automatically by the compiler without any explicit instruction (like a cast operator (type)) from the programmer.

```java
int myInt = 10;
double myDouble = myInt; // int is implicitly converted to double
// output : 10.0
```

```java
int myInt = 10;
long myLong = myInt; // int is implicitly converted to long
// Note : myInt will remain as int but its value will be converted to long
```

```java
int x = 5;
double y = 2.5;
double result = x + y; // 'x' (int) is implicitly converted to double
```

```java
long m = 1234567890123456789L;
float n = m;
System.out.println(n);
```

#### Condition for Implicit Type Conversion
- Converting from a "smaller" data type to a "larger" (or more encompassing) data type.
- The conversion is guaranteed by the compiler to be "safe," meaning no loss of information or accuracy is possible.

**Important Point**

Automatic Type Conversion (Widening): Leads to memory inefficiency because a value that could fit in a smaller data type is now stored in a larger one, consuming more memory than the bare minimum.


### Explicit Type Conversion (Explicit Widening, Type Casting, Narrowing Conversion)

This refers to the conversion of one data type to another data type that happens explicitly by the programmer using a cast operator (type).


```java
double d = 98.765;
int i = (int) d; // Explicitly casting double to int
System.out.println("Original double: " + d); // Output: 98.765
System.out.println("Converted int: " + i);   // Output: 98 (fractional part is lost)
```

```java
float f = 12345.67f;
long l = (long) f; // Explicitly casting float to long
System.out.println("Original float: " + f); // Output: 12345.67
System.out.println("Converted long: " + l); // Output: 12345 (fractional part lost)
```
