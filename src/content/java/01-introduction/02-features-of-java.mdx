Java comes with several powerful features â€” often referred to as **Java Buzzwords** â€” that make it a reliable, flexible, and widely-used programming language.

## ðŸš€ Key Features of Java (Buzzwords)

- âœ… **Simple**  
  Java is easy to learn, write, and understand. It removes complex features like pointers and operator overloading.

- âœ… **Object-Oriented**  
  Everything in Java is treated as an object. This promotes modular, reusable, and maintainable code using concepts like classes, inheritance, and polymorphism.

- âœ… **Secure**  
  Java provides built-in security through bytecode verification, access control, and no direct memory access (no pointers).

- âœ… **Robust**  
  Java emphasizes strong memory management, exception handling, and compile-time checking to build reliable applications.

- âœ… **Architecture-Neutral**  
  Java code is compiled into bytecode, which runs on any machine regardless of hardware architecture (Intel, ARM, etc.).

- âœ… **Cross-Platform**  
  Java applications can run on all major platforms like Windows, macOS, and Linux without modification.

- âœ… **Interpreted**  
  Java source code is compiled into bytecode, which is interpreted and executed by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).

- âœ… **Platform-Independent**  
    - With the JVM, Java achieves the "Write Once, Run Anywhere" philosophy. You can run Java code on any OS with a compatible JVM.  
    - C and C++ are not platform-independent by default.
      But they can be cross-platform with extra effort.

- âœ… **Multithreaded**  
  Java supports multithreading â€” enabling applications to perform multiple tasks simultaneously using built-in `Thread` classes and concurrency APIs.
