Java is a general-purpose, class-based, object-oriented programming language. It is a versatile, high-level language used to develop a wide range of applications â€” from mobile apps to large-scale enterprise and cloud systems.

## ðŸ”§ Applications That Can Be Built Entirely With Java

These are types of software that can be built using **only Java**, often with supporting Java tools like Spring Boot, JavaFX, Android SDK, etc.

- **Android Mobile Applications**  
  (Using Java + XML for layout, via Android SDK)

- **Enterprise Web Applications**  
  (Using Spring Boot or Java EE for full-stack backend + frontend with JSP or Thymeleaf)

- **Desktop Applications**  
  (Using JavaFX or Swing for GUI)

- **Command-line Tools & Utilities**  
  (Pure Java, used for automation and scripting)

- **Backend APIs and Microservices**  
  (Using frameworks like Spring Boot, Micronaut, etc.)

- **Internet of Things (IoT) Systems**  
  (Using Java ME for embedded devices)

## ðŸ§© Applications Where Java Is One of Several Languages

These are systems where **Java handles a major part**, but other languages are used alongside for specialized roles:

- **Cloud Platforms (e.g., AWS, GCP, Azure)**  
  Java is used for backend services and SDKs, but the platform also uses Go, C++, Python, Rust, etc.

- **Big Data Ecosystems**  
  Java powers core tools like Hadoop and Kafka, while users often write data processing in Scala, Python, or SQL.

- **Web Applications Backend (Modern Architecture)**  
  Java is used for the backend (APIs), while frontend is handled by JavaScript frameworks like React, Vue, or Angular.

- **Hybrid Mobile Apps (e.g., React Native, Flutter)**  
  Java is used for native modules or bridging, while the app is mainly built in JS (React Native) or Dart (Flutter).

- **Scientific and Research Applications**  
  Java handles simulation engines or background processing, while data visualization or scripting might be in Python or R.

- **Gaming**  
  Java is used in engines like jMonkeyEngine or LibGDX, but high-end games often include C++ or scripting languages for rendering and physics.
