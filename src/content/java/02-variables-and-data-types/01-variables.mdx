A **variable** in Java is a named location in memory used to store data. Each variable has:
- A **type** (such as `int`, `String`, etc.)
- A **name**
- (Optionally) A **value**

---

### âœ… Declaring Variables

To declare a variable, specify the **data type** followed by the **variable name**:

```java
int age;
short height;
String name;
```

This tells Java to create three variables:

* `age` of type `int` (integer)
* `height` of type `short` (small integer)
* `name` of type `String` (text)



### âœ… Assigning Values to Variables

After declaring a variable, you can assign a value using the `=` operator:

```java
age = 25;
height = 180;
name = "Mohd Hamza";
```

---

### âœ… Declaring and Assigning Together

You can also declare and assign a value in **one line** (this is common and cleaner):

```java
int age = 25;
short height = 180;
String name = "Mohd Hamza";
```
